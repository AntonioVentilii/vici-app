// Vendored candid bindings for the on-chain engine (clearing + registry) and
// the legacy satellite (used only by the ETL drain tooling). The clearing/**,

//   idlFactory*          : plain factories (query calls execute as queries).
//   idlFactoryCertified* : query/composite_query stripped, so every method is
//                          issued as a signed update call with a certified
//                          response. Used for the write paths.
