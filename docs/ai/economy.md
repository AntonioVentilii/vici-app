# VXP economy — governing rules

This is the **policy layer** for the VXP economy: the rules every mint
must respect, why the deliberate constraints exist, and how the code
stays in sync with them. It is the compulsory reference for any change
that mints, gates, caps, or recovers VXP.

Read alongside:

- [`PRODUCT.md` §VXP economy](./PRODUCT.md#vxp-economy) — what the
  product does (shipped behaviour).
- [`satellite/economy.md`](./satellite/economy.md) — how an award is
  implemented (invariants + new-award-type checklist).
- The three constants files, which are the **single source of truth
  for every value**:
  [`vxp-economy.constants.ts`](../../src/lib/constants/vxp-economy.constants.ts),
  [`referral.constants.ts`](../../src/lib/constants/referral.constants.ts),
  [`vxp-onboarding.constants.ts`](../../src/lib/constants/vxp-onboarding.constants.ts).

## Reconciliation protocol — the rules drive the code

The repository's default [truth hierarchy](./governance.md#truth-hierarchy)
puts code above docs: for _what the product currently does_, the code
wins. **Economy policy is the one scoped exception.** For the
_rules_ of the economy — which surfaces mint, what gates and caps bound
each, and the anti-farming posture — **this page is authoritative**:

- An agent that finds the code diverging from a rule stated here
  **reconciles the code to the rule** (it does not silently "fix" the
  doc to match a drifted implementation), and says so in its PR.
- While reconciling — or any time it is asked to touch an earn surface
  — the agent **proposes anti-farming improvements**. Minting VXP for
  near-zero cost is the standing threat; every change to a mint is an
  occasion to ask "how is this farmed, and what bounds it?"
- _Values_ remain owned by the constants files, and _shipped
  behaviour_ remains described by [`PRODUCT.md`](./PRODUCT.md). This
  exception covers economy **rules**, not numbers and not behaviour
  descriptions.
- If a rule here genuinely no longer fits the product, that is a
  **policy change**: update this page deliberately (with the
  rationale), then reconcile the code — never the reverse.

This is what "the economy is part of the product" means in practice:
the rules are governed, and the implementation follows them.

## Principles

1. **Earn-only — there are no VXP sinks.** Nothing charges VXP. The
   only VXP that leaves a user is a prediction **stake**, and a stake
   is on-chain **clearing collateral** held by the risk engine, not a
   fee or a forfeit — it returns on settlement (won, lost, or
   broken-even) as realized cashflow. League founding is free and
   _awards_ VXP. There is no burn.
2. **The closed loop lives in the clearing engine, not in VXP
   mint/burn.** Because stakes are collateral, the zero-sum
   player-vs-market dynamic is enforced by the engine's settlement, not
   by sinks on the VXP supply. VXP supply is therefore controlled by
   **bounding every mint** (next section), not by draining it.
3. **Client previews the expected payout; the server is authoritative
   for the actual credit.** The FE computes the expected return for UI
   (the payout formula in
   [`vxp-economy.utils.ts`](../../src/lib/utils/vxp-economy.utils.ts));
   the satellite computes and transfers the real amount. Where a reward
   amount could be inferred client-side it is **cosmetic** — the
   satellite recomputes it from its own authoritative state before
   paying.
4. **Two numbers share the name "VXP."** The ledger **token** balance
   (holdings = available + backed collateral) and the lifetime
   **points** score (drives level/rank, only grows) are different
   numbers — see [`PRODUCT.md`](./PRODUCT.md#vxp--two-different-numbers-share-the-name).
   This page governs the **token** economy.
5. **Every award is a real ICRC transfer**, recorded in `vxp_awards`
   with lifecycle `pending → paid | failed` — never a cosmetic
   counter. The implementation invariants for this are in
   [`satellite/economy.md`](./satellite/economy.md).

## Earn surfaces

The surfaces that mint VXP, the rule for each, and the constant that
backs it. Amounts are **not** repeated here — follow the link.

The authoritative list of award **types** is the `VxpAwardType` union
([`vxp-award.ts`](../../src/lib/types/vxp-award.ts)) mirrored by the
`VxpAwardTypeSchema` Zod enum
([`vxp-award.schema.ts`](../../src/lib/schema/vxp-award.schema.ts)) —
both must carry every type (see
[`satellite/economy.md`](./satellite/economy.md#invariants)).

## Caps and gates — the anti-farming spine

With no sinks, **the caps are the economy's stability mechanism.**
Every mint must be bounded so it cannot become an unbounded faucet.
The bound that protects each surface today:

- **Prediction win** — bounded by the `p_win` floor (caps the long-shot
  multiple) and the stake ladder cap.
- **Referrer reward** — diminishing curve **and** a hard lifetime cap
  to zero; the count comes from the satellite's own scan, so the client
  cannot inflate it.
- **Referee reward** — one-time per account, only inside the
  post-signup redemption window.
- **Streak / flow-volume milestones** — one-time per milestone, per
  lifetime.
- **Calibration** — balance-gated (pays only below the recovery floor),
  plus a daily **and** an hourly burst cap.
- **Comeback** — balance-gated and absence-gated.
- **League founder** — lifetime per-account cap.

Every server-fired award is also keyed for **idempotency** in
`vxp_awards` (`recipient/awardType/awardKey`), so a hook retry can
never double-pay — see
[`satellite/economy.md`](./satellite/economy.md#invariants).

## Known open farm vectors

Recorded deliberately so the next agent inherits them. These are
**recommendations**, not shipped guards — none is implemented yet.

1. **New-account mint (sybil).** The onboarding grant plus the referee
   bonus is the largest mint a brand-new account can collect, and it
   needs no prior activity. The current defense is
   **Internet-Identity-gated sign-up** (a fresh identity per account
   has a real cost). Harden further only if abuse appears. Tracking:
   **#543**.
2. **Payouts trust the client-written activity log.** Referral and
   onboarding payouts trigger off the user's `activities` collection (a
   client write), not an authoritative engine trade — so a spoofed
   activity could in principle trigger a payout. Gating these on an
   authoritative trade is the recommended fix. Tracking: **#543**.
3. **Repeatable overtime mint.** The overtime bonus is gated on raw
   daily call count, and stakes are returnable collateral (not a cost),
   so once its credit path is wired (#350) it could be farmed with
   throwaway calls. Recommendation: gate it on **distinct markets** and
   a **minimum stake** before it mints. Tracking: **#350**.
4. **Low-cost founder mint.** Founding a league is a single free write,
   so the lifetime founder cap still permits a sizeable mint for
   near-zero effort. Recommendation: require a **membership / activity
   quality gate** before the founder award fires.

When you implement any of these, move it out of this list and into the
caps section above, and update the constants — not this page — with the
new numbers.

## Design constraints and rejected alternatives

The non-obvious "why" behind the rules above.

- **Why earn-only, not a closed sink-based economy.** A self-contained
  model where lost stakes are forfeited and entries cost VXP only makes
  sense when the currency is purely cosmetic. Here stakes are real
  on-chain clearing collateral settled by the risk engine, so a
  "forfeit" would double-count the loss the engine already realizes.
  The closed loop is enforced in clearing; VXP supply is bounded by the
  caps instead. A sink-based design was therefore rejected.
- **Why the referrer reward diminishes and hard-caps, but the referee
  reward is flat.** The referee bonus lands in throwaway alt accounts
  at worst; the referrer bonus accumulates in a real, persistent,
  leaderboard-affecting account — that is the sybil-valuable mint, so
  it is the one that decays and is capped. A flat referrer reward with
  a periodic cap was rejected because the lifetime curve self-limits
  without a blunt wall, letting genuine super-connectors keep referring
  real friends at the floor.
- **Why both comeback restore and calibration recovery exist.** They
  serve different users: comeback is a one-time **re-engagement** nudge
  triggered by _absence_, calibration is an ongoing **skill-based**
  climb triggered by _depletion while present_. They are kept distinct
  rather than unified so a returning user is not forced into a grind to
  get unstuck, and an active depleted user still has a skill path.
- **Why the onboarding grant is a single up-front amount.** It is sized
  to carry a new user through their first predict → resolve → payout
  loop before any wall, so they experience the win loop before the
  scarcity loop. An engagement-gated drip was rejected as friction;
  gameplay payouts, the first-call achievement, and the referral bonus
  reward continued play instead.
- **Why a `p_win` floor.** Without it a near-certain-loser side would
  pay an enormous multiple of stake, draining the economy through one
  surface. The floor caps the long-shot payout to a bounded multiple.
