# Stack & Patterns

Idiomatic patterns for the **SvelteKit 2 + Svelte 5 + TypeScript +
Tailwind v4** stack as it lives in this repo. If a pattern here disagrees
with code in `src/`, the code wins (truth hierarchy in
[governance.md](../governance.md)). Update this page in the same PR —
that's the [meta-update rule](../governance.md#meta-update-rule).

## Svelte 5 — runes everywhere

This project is **Svelte 5** and uses runes for new code:

| Use (new code)                                                                                     | Don't use (Svelte 4 style)                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Separate `interface Props { … }` + `let { … }: Props = $props()` (see [Props shape](#props-shape)) | `export let foo`                              |
| `let count = $state(0)`                                                                            | plain `let` for component-local reactive vars |
| `let total = $derived(price * qty)`                                                                | `$: total = price * qty`                      |
| `$effect(() => { /* I/O */ })`                                                                     | side-effect via `$:`                          |
| `<button onclick={fn}>`                                                                            | `on:click`                                    |
| `{#snippet}` + `{@render}`                                                                         | named `<slot>` for new code                   |

### Props shape

Always declare props as a **named `interface Props`** above the
destructuring, declared **inside** the component file. This keeps the
shape easy to read and easy to extend in tests / sibling components:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import type { Snippet } from 'svelte';
	import type { Market } from '$lib/types/market';

	interface Props {
		market: Market;
		highlight?: boolean;
		onSelect?: (id: Market['id']) => void;
		footer?: Snippet;
	}

	let { market, highlight = false, onSelect = () => {}, footer }: Props = $props();
</script>
```

Rules:

- One `interface Props` per component, declared at the top of the
  `<script>` after imports.
- Required props first, optional / defaulted ones after.
- Callbacks default to a no-op (`() => {}`) so callers can omit them.
- **Avoid `$bindable`** unless explicitly required. The repo prefers
  callback props (`onChange`) over two-way bindings.
- Do **not** inline the type literal into `$props()` for new code — use a
  named `interface Props`.

### Effect hygiene

- Never read state inside an `$effect` and write it back without a guard —
  it loops. Restructure to `$derived` whenever possible.
- The write-then-read order does **not** save you: an effect that assigns
  `foo` and reads `foo` anywhere in the same body still registers `foo` as
  its own dependency. If the assigned value is a fresh identity each run
  (array/object literal, `JSON.parse`, `.map(...)`), the effect re-triggers
  itself until Svelte aborts the whole flush with
  `effect_update_depth_exceeded` — which freezes **every** component on the
  page, not just the offender. Read the just-computed local instead, or wrap
  the read in `untrack(...)`. (Bit the Arena standing hero: its cache-seed
  effect assigned `scopes` a fresh array and then read it in the
  `idx >= scopes.length` clamp, hard-freezing `/arena`.)
- Prefer `$derived` over `$effect`. An `$effect` is for I/O (DOM, network,
  storage). Computation belongs in `$derived` / `$derived.by`.

### Reactive reads — no hidden captures

Props returned by `$props()` and values bound to `$state` are **reactive
accessors**. Reading them outside a reactive context (`$derived`,
`$derived.by`, `$effect`, template expressions, or lifecycle / event
callbacks) captures the **initial value only** — later prop changes will
not propagate.

`svelte-check` flags the obvious form:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	let { result }: Props = $props();
	const isSkip = result === 'SKIP'; // ⚠ state_referenced_locally
</script>
```

The linter **does not catch** reads hidden inside a function body that
executes eagerly at module init — the classic offender is an IIFE:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	let { correct }: Props = $props();

	// ❌ BUG: `correct` is captured at init; later prop changes won't reflect.
	const phraseKey = (() => {
		if (correct) return 'flow.feedback.right_1';
		return 'flow.feedback.wrong_1';
	})();
</script>
```

The correct shapes:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	let { correct }: Props = $props();

	// ✅ Pure derivation — re-runs when `correct` changes.
	const phraseKey = $derived(correct ? 'flow.feedback.right_1' : 'flow.feedback.wrong_1');

	// ✅ Same idea, multi-statement body.
	const phraseKey2 = $derived.by(() => {
		if (correct) return 'flow.feedback.right_1';
		return 'flow.feedback.wrong_1';
	});
</script>
```

If you need a value that is computed **once per mount** but seeded from
non-reactive inputs (e.g. `Math.random()`), keep the seed at module
scope and feed it through `$derived` for the prop-dependent part:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	let { correct }: Props = $props();

	const idx = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3); // stable per mount
	const phraseKey = $derived(
		(correct ? RIGHT_KEYS : WRONG_KEYS)[idx] // reactive on `correct`
	);
</script>
```

Rule of thumb: if a `const` at module scope reads a prop or `$state`
binding — directly **or** inside an immediately-invoked function — wrap
it in `$derived` / `$derived.by`. Top-level IIFEs whose bodies touch
reactive bindings are an anti-pattern; the only safe IIFE is one that
lives **inside** a reactive context (`$derived(...)`, `$effect(...)`,
`onMount(...)`, …).

### Stores still exist

Svelte stores (`writable` / `readable` / `derived` from `svelte/store`)
remain the primary cross-route reactive primitive in this repo. The graph
under `$lib/stores/` and `$lib/derived/` is mature — keep adding to it
where it fits an existing shape, rather than splitting the world between
runes and stores.

| Need                                           | Use                                                                    | Where it lives       |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Component-local mutable value                  | `$state`                                                               | Inside the component |
| Component-local computed value                 | `$derived` / `$derived.by`                                             | Inside the component |
| Side effect (DOM, network, subscription)       | `$effect` (or `onMount` for true mount work)                           | Inside the component |
| Value shared by 2+ components in the same page | Pass via props / snippets                                              | —                    |
| Value shared across views (markets, wallet, …) | A Svelte `writable` / `readable` store, or a `*.svelte.ts` rune module | `$lib/stores/`       |
| Computed value across stores                   | `derived(...)` Svelte store                                            | `$lib/derived/`      |

Avoid duplicating server / canister state into a local store — fetch via
the service layer and let the service own caching.

## TypeScript

- **No `any`.** Use `unknown` and narrow.
- **No `as unknown as X`** to launder types. Either fix the type, or write
  a narrowing function.
- **No non-null assertion (`!`)** on values that can actually be null —
  use `isNullish` / `nonNullish` from `@dfinity/utils`, optional chaining,
  or an explicit guard with an early return.
- **No direct nullish comparisons** (eslint): `x === null`,
  `x !== undefined`, loose `x == null`, … are all banned — write
  `isNullish(x)` / `nonNullish(x)` from `@dfinity/utils` instead. The
  helpers are type guards, so narrowing works the same.
- **Generated types are the source of truth at canister boundaries.**
  Always import types from `$declarations/<canister>/<canister>.did` for
  request / response shapes — never re-declare them.
- **Schemas first.** When data crosses a boundary (network, storage, the
  satellite), validate with the matching `zod` schema from
  `$lib/schema/`.
- **Discriminated unions** for `Result<T>` flows. Look at the closest
  neighbour and follow the same shape.
- **Type imports**: prefer `import type { … }` for types-only;
  `prettier-plugin-organize-imports` will sort them.
- **`BigInt` zero**: forbidden literal `0n` (eslint). Use the `ZERO`
  constant from `$lib/constants/app.constants`.
- **`catch` bindings are always `: unknown`.** Even when the binding is
  unused (`catch (_: unknown)`, `catch (_e: unknown)`). The annotation is
  redundant under `strict` (TS already infers `unknown`), but we write it
  explicitly so intent is visible at the call site and so a future
  `strict: false` slip can't silently widen it back to `any`. Narrow with
  `instanceof Error` or a `zod` schema before reading properties.
- **Optional over a sentinel for "not known yet".** When a numeric field
  can be genuinely unknown (still loading, or empty), model it as
  optional (`field?: number`) and let consumers render a skeleton /
  placeholder for `isNullish` — do not pick a magic in-range default that
  is indistinguishable from a real value. `Market.yesProbability` is the
  worked example: a `0.5` default read as a real coin-flip and showed
  un-loaded markets as 50%. It is now optional, paired with a
  `priceLoaded` boolean that separates _loading_ (skeleton) from
  _loaded-but-empty_ (dash); the odds placeholder is
  `$lib/components/market/MarketOddsSkeleton.svelte`. See
  [`PRODUCT.md`](../PRODUCT.md) → "Market odds".
- **Pulsating placeholders go through the one canonical pulse.** For any
  "data is loading" placeholder block, use the `Skeleton` UI primitive
  (or, when the geometry already lives in scoped CSS, add the global
  `.skeleton` class — defined once in `app.css` beside the `char-*` idle
  loops, reduced-motion safe). Never hand-roll an `animate-pulse` block or
  a per-component pulse keyframe. The spinner equivalent is
  `LoadingSpinner`. See [`reusability.md`](./reusability.md) → `Skeleton`.

## Service / data flow

```
Component (.svelte)
  ↳ $lib/services/*.services.ts          orchestration, state mutations, error handling
       ↳ $lib/api/*.api.ts               wrappers around generated canister declarations
       ↳ $lib/canisters/*.canister.ts    typed actor factories
       ↳ @junobuild/core                 datastore + auth (used directly inside services)
```

- Components **do not** call `setDoc` / `getDoc` / `listDocs` / `fetch`
  directly. Always go through the matching service module.
- A `*.services.ts` function should:
  - Accept a typed input.
  - Use the identity helpers from
    [`$lib/services/identity.services.ts`](../../../src/lib/services/identity.services.ts)
    (`getIdentityOrAnonymous` for read paths, `safeGetIdentityOnce` for
    authenticated actions).
  - Surface errors via the project's notification / toast pattern (`$lib/stores/notification.store`).
  - Never throw to the caller for expected user errors — return an
    informative result.
- Worker-bound logic (auth workers) lives under `static/workers/` and is
  synced by `npm run postinstall`. Don't hand-edit those files.

Example shape (compressed from
[`$lib/services/market.services.ts`](../../../src/lib/services/market.services.ts)):

```ts
import { registryApi } from '$lib/api/registry.api';
import { VICI_ENGINE_ID } from '$lib/constants/icdc.constants';
import { safeGetIdentityOnce } from '$lib/services/identity.services';
import type { CreateMarketRequest } from '$lib/types/market';

export const createMarket = async (req: CreateMarketRequest): Promise<MarketId> => {
	const identity = await safeGetIdentityOnce();
	const engineId = req.userIsCreator ? VICI_ENGINE_ID : null;
	return registryApi.addSeries({ identity, engineId, ...req });
};
```

## Engine integration (icdc-core)

Vici talks to the on-chain Rust canisters in `../icdc-core/`. The Engine
model — what `engine_id` to pass, who has `Creator` / `OracleAdmin`, how
roles in Juno are mirrored to the Vici engine — is documented in
[`docs/engine-integration.md`](../../engine-integration.md). When writing
a new market / oracle path, **read that doc first**. The single place that
pins `VICI_ENGINE_ID` is
[`src/lib/constants/icdc.constants.ts`](../../../src/lib/constants/icdc.constants.ts).

### Call size is a FE fixed-stake skin over the CLOB

The engine is a **share-based CLOB**: an order is `(price, qty)` where `qty`
is a number of outcome shares (each pays `1` on win) and the locked margin is
`qty × price`. The UI never exposes shares — it presents a **fixed-stake**
("call size") convention: the slider value is the VXP you spend, you lose
exactly that if wrong, and a win pays `stake / price`. The two are the same
trade — spending `stake` to buy `stake / price` shares — so this is a
**pure FE presentation layer; the ICDC `(price, qty)` convention is
untouched.** The conversion is the one line in
[`executeOutcomeTrade`](../../../src/lib/utils/trade.utils.ts):
`qty = collateral / price`.

The `price` in both the order sizing **and** the "+X VXP" payout preview is the
**order-book execution price**, resolved once by
[`resolveOutcomeExecutionPrice`](../../../src/lib/utils/market.utils.ts) (best
ask for YES, `1 − best bid` for NO, consensus mid only when that side of the
book is empty). Always size previews off this helper, never off the consensus
mid (`yesProbability`) — the mid ignores the spread and over-promises the
payout on a thin / one-sided book. Net payout itself is computed by
[`vxpNetWin`](../../../src/lib/utils/vxp-economy.utils.ts) (`stake / price −
stake`, with a `VXP_P_WIN_FLOOR` cap on long-shot display). The flow card does
**not** load full book depth (a known N+1 perf footgun), so the preview models
spread-level slippage from top-of-book, not multi-level depth walking.

## Identity & auth

- Principal source of truth:
  [`src/lib/services/identity.services.ts`](../../../src/lib/services/identity.services.ts).
- Use `getIdentityOrAnonymous` for public-read views.
- Use `safeGetIdentityOnce` for authenticated actions (it triggers the
  sign-in flow once if the user is anonymous).
- Auth uses Internet Identity + Google OpenID via Juno. The OpenID client
  IDs and delegation duration live in
  [`juno.config.ts`](../../../juno.config.ts).
- Auth worker assets must be synced via `npm run postinstall` to
  `./static/workers` — otherwise sign-in silently breaks.
- **Apple sign-in bypasses Juno on purpose.** Juno's `signIn()` has no
  Apple provider and no OpenID deep-link for its II provider, so
  "Continue with Apple" goes straight to Internet Identity 2.0 (`id.ai`)
  with `?openid=…appleid.apple.com` — see
  [`apple-signin.services.ts`](../../../src/lib/services/apple-signin.services.ts).
  It drives the **ICRC-29 `Signer` / `PostMessageTransport` directly**
  (not `AuthClient.signIn()`): `AuthClient` hard-codes the transport's 2s
  `disconnectTimeout`, which drops the channel ("Connection closed") while
  the popup is off on Apple's OIDC ceremony — so we build the transport
  ourselves with a passkey-aware 60s timeout, request the delegation, and
  persist it by hand. The signer / storage primitives come from
  `@icp-sdk/auth` v6 + `@icp-sdk/signer`, installed under the
  **`icp-auth-openid` npm alias** (`npm:@icp-sdk/auth@^6`) so Juno keeps
  its own peer `@icp-sdk/auth` v5 untouched — never import `icp-auth-openid`
  from anything Juno owns, and never bump Juno's peer to v6 (v6 dropped the
  `AuthClient.create` / `login` API Juno calls). v5 and v6 share an
  identical IndexedDB contract (`auth-client-db` / `ic-keyval`, ECDSA key
  under `identity` + delegation JSON under `delegation`), so the
  hand-persisted delegation is adopted by Juno on the next document load.
  **Persisting the delegation is not enough**: Juno's boot-time
  `loadAuth()` only _loads_ an existing `#user` doc (it never creates one —
  that's done inside Juno's interactive `signIn()`), so the service also
  creates the `#user` doc with the Apple identity (mirroring Juno's
  `initUser`); skip this and `loadAuth()` finds a valid delegation but no
  user and the app drops straight back to the signed-out screen. That
  adoption is why Apple sign-in ends with a **full `window.location.assign`**
  (not a client `goto`): only a fresh load re-runs `initSatellite()` /
  `loadAuth()`, which resolves the user and fires `onAuthStateChange`. Flush
  host state (e.g. the signup onboarding `onSuccess` that persists pending
  picks to storage) before that reload.
- **Passkey: `signUp` creates, `signIn` authenticates.** Juno's WebAuthn
  provider splits the two, and only `signUp` accepts a display name for the
  new credential. `SignInProviderStack` takes a `mode` (`signin` | `signup`)
  prop and branches the passkey button on it: the onboarding flow passes
  `mode="signup"` (plus the chosen `handle`) so a brand-new user registers a
  passkey labelled `VICI · {handle}`; every other mount (the /signin gate,
  the "sign in to continue" modals) defaults to `mode="signin"` and
  authenticates an existing passkey. The label flips between
  `authn.passkey.create_button` and `authn.passkey.signin_button` the same
  way.
- **Email sign-in is passkey-backed — there is no magic link.** The email
  row in `SignInProviderStack` is a friendlier framing of the WebAuthn flow:
  on sign-up it registers a passkey labelled by the address and merges that
  address into the `vici:pending-onboarding` payload (same single-field merge
  `/i/[code]` and `/league/[code]` do for their codes), so the post-sign-in
  drain in [`(app)/+layout.svelte`](<../../../src/routes/(app)/+layout.svelte>)
  persists it onto the new profile — the WebAuthn `User` carries no email of
  its own. On sign-in it just authenticates the existing passkey. Because it
  is WebAuthn under the hood it shares the passkey button's gating
  (`isWebAuthnAvailable` + production-only). The settings "Sign-in method" row
  reads `profile.email` to label these accounts.
- **Identity-scoped browser storage must be dropped on a principal change.**
  `localStorage` is device-wide and shared across accounts on the same
  browser. Any key holding state that belongs to a specific signed-in user
  (caps, counters, read-state, "seen" flags) WILL bleed into the next
  account unless it is cleared on the auth transition. The single chokepoint
  is
  [`reconcileIdentityScopedStorage`](../../../src/lib/services/identity-storage.services.ts),
  called from
  [`Authn.svelte`](../../../src/lib/components/authn/Authn.svelte) on every
  `onAuthStateChange`. It compares the new principal against a persisted
  owner (`vici.storage-owner.v1`) and wipes the identity-scoped caches
  **only when the owner actually changes** — never on a same-user reload,
  so the offline-resilient daily-goal mirror survives a refresh. When you
  add a new user-scoped persisted key, register its reset there (and prefer
  routing genuinely cross-device state through `profile.preferences`
  instead — that store already resets on sign-out). Device-level keys
  (theme, locale, last-open tab) intentionally stay put.

## Tailwind v4 + design tokens

- **Use the project's tokens.** [`src/app.css`](../../../src/app.css)
  exposes the standard semantic palette (`primary`, `background`,
  `foreground`, `card`, `popover`, `muted-foreground`, `success`,
  `destructive`, `border`, `input`, …), plus repo-specific design
  tokens: the prediction signals (`yes` / `no` / `hold` and their
  `-deep` / `-wash` variants), the `danger` ramp (`danger` /
  `danger-deep` / `danger-wash`, a theme-stable terracotta), the
  `laurel` brand ramp (`laurel` /
  `laurel-deep` / `laurel-glow`), `ink`, `ink-line` /
  `ink-line-strong` (theme-stable parchment lines for surfaces with
  hard-coded dark backgrounds), `border-strong`, the `ease-vici`
  curve, and the `inset-hi` / `inset-hi-strong` / `modal` shadows. For
  values Tailwind v4 doesn't generate utilities for natively (custom
  transition durations, composed multi-shadow values), the file also
  defines `@utility` wrappers — currently `duration-hover` /
  `duration-state` (bound to `--d-hover` / `--d-state`) and
  `shadow-mobilenav-active`. Use the generated utilities directly —
  `bg-card`, `text-yes`, `bg-no-wash`, `border-border-strong`,
  `border-ink-line`, `shadow-inset-hi`, `ease-vici`, `duration-hover`,
  `bg-laurel/20`.
- **`danger` (terracotta) vs `no` / `destructive` (red) — do not
  conflate.** Destructive / irreversible-action UI (delete, sign-out,
  danger buttons / warnings) uses the `danger` ramp (`bg-danger`,
  `text-danger`, `hover:bg-danger-deep`, `bg-danger-wash`) so it reads
  as caution, not as a market outcome. The `no` signal (and the
  `destructive` alias that still maps to it) is reserved for the
  prediction **NO** outcome and financial-loss semantics — NO splits,
  probability bars, payouts, `out` wallet rows, order-book asks. When a
  red is a NO outcome / loss, keep it on `no` / `destructive`; when it's
  a destructive action, use `danger`.
- **No `[var(--…)]` arbitrary values for design tokens.** Tailwind v4
  generates `bg-foo` / `text-foo` / `border-foo` / `ring-foo` /
  `shadow-foo` / `ease-foo` utilities for every `--color-*`, `--shadow-*`
  and `--ease-*` token in `@theme`. If a token is missing from `@theme`,
  add it there in the same PR rather than reaching for
  `bg-[var(--my-token)]`. For values outside those Tailwind namespaces
  (custom transition durations, composed shadows), add an `@utility`
  wrapper instead of an arbitrary value with an embedded token. Same
  goes for `style="color: var(--foo)"` / `style="box-shadow: var(--foo)"`
  — use the utility.
- **No raw hex** (`bg-[#0f0]`).
- **Class order** is auto-sorted by `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`. Don't
  bikeshed it.
- **Variants & responsive:** prefer Tailwind variants (`md:`, `dark:`,
  `data-[active=true]:`) over JS branches.
- The repo ships a "premium glassmorphic" design system. Match what the
  closest neighbour uses; don't introduce a competing aesthetic.

## Icons

- Default to `@lucide/svelte` (`import { ArrowRight } from '@lucide/svelte';`).
- Bespoke icons live under `$lib/components/icons/`. Re-use them before
  inlining a new SVG.
- Decorative icons → `aria-hidden="true"`.
- Icon-only buttons → must have `aria-label`.

## Routing

- SvelteKit **file-based routes** under
  [`src/routes/(app)/`](<../../../src/routes/(app)/>) (`/`, `/flow`,
  `/markets/[id]`, …). Add a new view by adding a new
  `(app)/<path>/+page.svelte` (or sub-route) and a matching `AppPath`
  entry — there is no central nav store.
- The mobile tab bar
  ([`src/lib/components/layout/MobileNav.svelte`](../../../src/lib/components/layout/MobileNav.svelte))
  compares `page.url.pathname` to `AppPath` from
  [`src/lib/constants/routes.constants.ts`](../../../src/lib/constants/routes.constants.ts).
  Visible nav items (icon, label, path) are configured in
  [`src/lib/constants/nav.constants.ts`](../../../src/lib/constants/nav.constants.ts).
- Page-level shells composed inside specific routes live in
  `$lib/components/pages/` (or the matching feature folder).

## Performance

- Wrap expensive work in `$derived.by` (cached) or in a `derived(...)`
  Svelte store, not in the render path.
- `{#each items as item (item.id)}` with a stable key.
- Lazy-load heavy modules with dynamic `import()` inside an `$effect` /
  event handler when they aren't needed on first paint.

## Anti-patterns (do not do these)

- `export let foo` in new code.
- Inline type literal in `$props()` (`let { … }: { … } = $props()`).
- Reactive `$:` statements in new code.
- Module-scope IIFE (`const x = (() => { … })()`) whose body reads a
  `$props()` value or `$state` binding — captures the initial value
  only. Use `$derived` / `$derived.by` instead. See
  [Reactive reads — no hidden captures](#reactive-reads--no-hidden-captures).
- `$bindable` unless explicitly required by the API.
- Reaching into `document.querySelector` to mutate Svelte-managed DOM.
- Catching an error and silently swallowing it; surface via
  `$lib/stores/notification.store` or propagate.
- Hard-coding strings, hex colours, magic numbers in components.
- "Just one more `any`" — there is no "just one more".
- Adding a wrapper component that only re-exports another component.
- `target="_blank"` without `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
- `{@html …}` without sanitisation.
- `console.log` left in committed code.
- The word "bet" anywhere it could leak to a user (always "prediction").
- Time variables without a `_ms` / `_ns` suffix.
