# Spec: VXP transaction history page

This spec follows the workflow defined in
`docs/ai/spec-driven-development/workflow.md`.

Status: Draft

## Goal

From the holdings bottom sheet on `/dash`, the user can open a
dedicated **transaction history** page: a paginated, filterable,
chronological list of every event that changed their VXP — bonuses
received, predictions placed, wins, losses, cancellations, and
external transfers — each row showing the signed amount and, as the
last column, the **running available-VXP balance** after that event.

## Context

### Entry point

- `src/lib/components/dash/DashStackCard.svelte` — holdings card on
  `/dash`; opens the sheet.
- `src/lib/components/dash/DashStackSheet.svelte` — the bottom sheet
  (built on `src/lib/components/ui/BottomSheet.svelte`). Gains a new
  link row at the bottom navigating to the history page.

### Why this is not "just read the ledger"

Predictions do **not** produce per-stake ledger transfers:

- `src/lib/components/wallet/PlaygroundVxpAutoDeposit.svelte` sweeps
  free wallet VXP into the clearing canister's collateral account on a
  poller — ledger transfers are batched sweeps, not stakes.
- Orders lock margin from already-deposited collateral
  (`src/lib/api/clearing.api.ts` — `submitLimitOrder` /
  `submitMarketOrder`); settlements credit clearing equity. Neither
  touches the ledger.
- Bonuses **are** ledger transfers: every satellite payout goes
  through `transferWithBadFeeRetry`
  (`src/satellite/utils/vxp-payout.utils.ts`) with a
  `vxp:<awardType>:<key>` memo. Confirmed memo tags:
  `achievement`, `calibration`, `comeback`, `league_founder`,
  `new-user`, `referral`, `streak`, `tournament_prize`,
  `worlds_podium`.

So the page merges **two streams** into one feed:

1. **Clearing events** — `getTradeHistory`
   (`src/lib/api/clearing.api.ts`) returns all of the caller's
   `OrderPlaced` / `Executed` / `Settled` / `Liquidated` events in one
   unpaginated query call.
2. **VXP ledger transactions** — `getTransactions`
   (`src/lib/api/icrc-index-ng.api.ts`) pages through the ICRC index
   (`VXP_INDEX_CANISTER_ID_DEFAULT` in
   `src/lib/constants/canisters.constants.ts`).

### Existing plumbing to reuse

- `src/lib/types/wallet.ts` — the unified `Transaction` type already
  models both sources (`source: 'ledger' | 'clearing'`), including
  `CollateralDeposit`/`CollateralWithdraw` (sweeps, derived from
  counterparty = clearing canister) and a **reserved `Reward` type
  explicitly waiting for satellite payouts to be relabelled** — this
  spec cashes that in.
- `src/lib/utils/transactions.utils.ts` —
  `mapClearingEventToTransaction` and the ledger mappers; extend with
  memo parsing (`vxp:<type>:<key>` → `Reward` + award type).
- `src/lib/services/wallet.service.ts` — `getTransactionsPage`
  (multi-ledger merge for the wallet page; the new page needs a
  VXP-only variant that walks pages to exhaustion).
- UI: `src/lib/components/ui/Pagination.svelte` (numbered pages with
  ellipsis, used by the portfolio table),
  `src/lib/components/ui/EmptyState.svelte`,
  `src/lib/components/layout/ScreenHeader.svelte` (back affordance),
  `src/lib/components/wallet/WalletHistory.svelte` (reference table,
  stays untouched).
- Formatting: `formatToken`, `formatNanosecondsToDate` /
  `formatRelativeAgoFromNs` (`src/lib/utils/format.utils.ts`);
  VXP display helpers in `src/lib/utils/playground-display.utils.ts`.
- Current available balance anchor:
  `src/lib/derived/vxp-holdings.derived.ts`.

## Ledger model — row semantics and the running balance

The running balance column tracks **available (spendable) VXP** =
wallet ledger balance + free clearing margin. This matches the user's
mental model: placing a prediction visibly moves VXP out, a win brings
back stake + profit, a loss returns nothing.

| Event                          | Row label              | Available-VXP delta                      |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Ledger receive with `vxp:` memo | Bonus · `<award type>` | + amount                                 |
| Clearing `OrderPlaced`         | Prediction · `<market>`| − locked margin (stake)                  |
| Clearing order cancelled       | Cancelled · `<market>` | + released margin                        |
| Clearing `Settled`, return > 0 | Won · `<market>`       | + returned amount (stake + profit)       |
| Clearing `Settled`, return = 0 | Lost · `<market>`      | 0 (subtitle: "stake of `<n>` not returned") |
| Clearing `Liquidated`          | Liquidated · `<market>`| signed event amount                      |
| Other ledger send/receive/mint | Sent / Received        | ± amount                                 |
| Wallet↔clearing sweeps         | **hidden row**         | − transfer fee only (silently applied)   |

- Losses render **0**, not −stake: the stake already left available
  balance at placement; showing −stake again would double-count.
- Sweeps (`CollateralDeposit`/`CollateralWithdraw`) don't change
  available balance and are pure noise — hidden, **but** their ledger
  fee still debits the running balance, so the hidden rows participate
  in the balance computation.
- The balance column is computed **newest-first**: anchor on the
  current available balance from `vxp-holdings.derived.ts`, then walk
  backwards subtracting each row's delta. Integer math in base units
  only (`formatToken` at render time); cite `VXP_TOKEN` decimals and
  `USD_DECIMALS` from their canonical constants — clearing event
  amounts are in USD-decimal fixed units and must go through the
  existing decode helpers (see `mapClearingEventToTransaction`), never
  ad-hoc `/ 1e8` math.
- Win/loss colours: `--yes` / `--no` signals; bonuses use the accent;
  neutral rows muted.

## Scope

1. **Route** — `/dash/transactions`:
   `src/routes/(app)/dash/transactions/+page.svelte` importing a page
   shell per `docs/ai/frontend/structure.md`, a new `AppPath` entry
   in `src/lib/constants/routes.constants.ts`, page shell
   `src/lib/components/pages/DashTransactionsPage.svelte`.
   `ScreenHeader` with back to `/dash`; header shows current
   available VXP and an "in play" chip.
2. **Sheet link** — a real `<a>`/`<button>` row in
   `DashStackSheet.svelte` ("Transaction history" + chevron, accent
   tint), a11y-labelled per `docs/ai/frontend/a11y.md`.
3. **Data service** — a new service (per
   `docs/ai/frontend/workflows/new-service.md`) that fetches the full
   clearing history + walks the VXP index to exhaustion (capped),
   normalizes both streams into `Transaction[]`, labels `Reward` rows
   from memos, sorts newest-first, and computes running balances.
4. **Memo parsing** — extend `transactions.utils.ts` to decode the
   `vxp:<type>:<key>` memo bytes into an award type; unknown/absent
   memos from the satellite/minter principal fall back to a generic
   "Bonus" label.
5. **UI** — table/list with columns: activity (icon + label + market
   title), date/time, signed amount, running balance. Filter chips:
   All / Predictions / Results / Bonuses (client-side). Numbered
   pagination via `Pagination.svelte` (page size 10, via a named
   constant).
   `EmptyState` for zero transactions; a quiet footer line when the
   ledger walk hit the page cap ("older history not shown").
6. **i18n** — new `transactions.*` keys in **every** catalog under
   `src/lib/constants/messages/` (all supported locales in
   `SUPPORTED_LOCALES`).
7. **PRODUCT.md** — updated in the same PR.

### Out of scope

- No satellite / collection / icdc-core changes — the `vxp_awards`
  collection stays `read: 'controllers'`; bonus labeling comes from
  ledger memos, so no new endpoint is needed.
- Flow-session grants (`flow_milestone`, `flow_overtime`) have **no
  real VXP credit path yet** (deferred — issue #350); they cannot and
  will not appear. When #350 lands with the established memo format,
  they appear automatically.
- CSV export, per-row drill-down sheets, ICP/ckUSDC tokens (the wallet
  page already covers multi-token history).
- Changing `WalletHistory.svelte` or the wallet page.

## Linked issues

- Part of nothing / closes nothing — searched open issues (#810,
  #759, #543, #350): none is fixed by this spec. #350 is referenced
  above as a data-coverage caveat only.

## Analytics

Instrument (default yes):

- `transactions_viewed` — fired on page open. Props: `source`
  (`'dash_sheet' | 'direct'`), `count` (rows loaded).
- `transactions_filtered` — fired on filter-chip change. Props:
  `label` (`'all' | 'predictions' | 'results' | 'bonuses'`).

Both names land in **both** halves of the dual-source pair:
`src/lib/types/analytics-event.ts` (TS union) and
`src/lib/schema/analytics-event.schema.ts` (Zod mirror); capture via
`track` in `src/lib/services/analytics.services.ts`. Bounded
vocabularies only; no market ids beyond the existing `marketId` prop,
no amounts (economic values stay out of analytics).

Pagination clicks are not instrumented — page depth adds no decision
value beyond `count`.

## Design artifacts (frontend — optional)

- [`./2026-06-12-feat-transaction-history/mock.html`](./2026-06-12-feat-transaction-history/mock.html)
  — interactive mock of the sheet link row and the history page, with
  the mandatory theme switcher (`data-theme`: dark / light / peach)
  and a "copy instructions" button that serializes every chosen
  variant. Deleted post-merge.

## Technical requirements

Pure-frontend spec — no `src/satellite/**`, collection, or
icdc-core-facing changes. Client-side load characteristics, for the
record:

- **Calls per page open**: 1 × `getTradeHistory` (query, unpaginated
  by design of the clearing canister) + ⌈N/page⌉ × ICRC index
  `get_account_transactions` (query), N = user's lifetime VXP ledger
  txs. Cap the index walk with a constant (e.g.
  `TRANSACTION_HISTORY_MAX_LEDGER_PAGES`) so a pathological account
  cannot fan out unbounded; surface the truncation footer when hit.
- **Scalability**: at 10×–100× event volume the fetch-all approach
  degrades; the cap bounds it. Server-side pagination of
  `getTradeHistory` would be an icdc-core change — explicitly
  deferred until real users approach the cap.
- **No new storage**; everything is derived at view time.

## Implementation outline

1. Add the `AppPath` entry + route folder + page shell
   (`+page.svelte` → `DashTransactionsPage.svelte`).
2. Add memo decoding + `Reward` labeling to
   `src/lib/utils/transactions.utils.ts` (unit-test the memo parser:
   all nine tags, unknown tag, absent memo, non-UTF8 bytes).
3. New `transaction-history.services.ts`: fetch both streams, merge,
   sort by timestamp desc, hide sweep rows (keep fee deltas), compute
   running balances anchored on current available VXP.
4. Build the page UI: `ScreenHeader`, filter chips, list rows, signed
   amounts (`--yes`/`--no`/accent), `Pagination.svelte`,
   `EmptyState`, truncation footer.
5. Add the `DashStackSheet` link row.
6. Add `transactions.*` i18n keys to every locale catalog.
7. Wire `transactions_viewed` / `transactions_filtered` (union + Zod
   + `track`).
8. Update `PRODUCT.md`; run `npm run quality` and `npm run check`.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Tapping the new row in the holdings sheet on `/dash` opens the
      history page; back returns to `/dash`.
- [ ] The page lists bonuses (labelled by award type from the ledger
      memo), predictions placed, wins, losses, cancellations, and
      external transfers, newest first.
- [ ] Wallet↔clearing collateral sweeps do not appear as rows.
- [ ] The last column shows the running available-VXP balance; the
      top row's balance equals the currently displayed available VXP,
      and consecutive rows differ exactly by the row delta (fees of
      hidden sweeps accounted).
- [ ] Lost predictions show amount 0 with the stake noted in the
      subtitle — never a second −stake.
- [ ] Filter chips restrict the list client-side without refetching.
- [ ] Numbered pagination via `Pagination.svelte`; empty state when
      no transactions; truncation footer when the ledger-walk cap is
      hit.
- [ ] All user-visible strings go through `t(...)` with keys present
      in every locale catalog (`npm run check:i18n` clean).
- [ ] Both analytics events fire and exist in the TS union **and**
      the Zod schema.
- [ ] Works in all three themes (dark / light / peach); win/loss use
      `--yes`/`--no` tokens, no hardcoded colours.
- [ ] `npm run quality` and `npm run check` pass.

## Open questions

- **Memo coverage on mainnet** — do all historical bonus transfers
  carry the `vxp:` memo (early payouts may predate the format)?
  Verify against a real account; absent memos fall back to the
  generic "Bonus" label, so this only affects label quality.
- **ICRC index memo availability** — confirm the index canister's
  transaction records expose memo bytes through the `@icp-sdk` types
  used by `icrc-index-ng.api.ts`.
- **Clearing event amount semantics** — verify per event type which
  field carries the locked/released/returned amount, against
  `mapClearingEventToTransaction` and the documented trap that a
  `Settled` event's signed qty **is** the cashflow (decode with the
  existing fixed-decimal helper).
- **Available-balance anchor reliability** — the clearing
  account-state query is Settlement-domain-scoped; confirm
  `vxp-holdings.derived.ts` exposes a stable available-VXP value to
  anchor the newest-first walk, including while markets are open.

## Decisions

- **Route: `/dash/transactions`** (owner decision, 2026-06-12) —
  nested under its entry point, back returns to `/dash`; page shell
  `DashTransactionsPage.svelte`. Top-level `/transactions` rejected:
  its only entry point is the dash sheet.
- **Page size: 10** (owner decision, 2026-06-12) — matches the
  portfolio tables and the wallet history default batch.

- **Running balance = available (spendable) VXP**, not total
  holdings: stakes visibly debit, wins credit stake + profit, losses
  are 0-rows. Total-holdings semantics would render stake rows as
  zero-delta, which contradicts the approved mockup and user
  intuition.
- **Bonus labels from ledger memos, not a new satellite endpoint** —
  `vxp_awards` stays controllers-only; every payout already writes a
  parseable `vxp:<type>:<key>` memo, so the FE can label rewards with
  zero backend surface. A satellite query would add an endpoint, an
  instruction budget, and a second source of truth for no extra data.
- **Fetch-all + client-side numbered pagination** over lazy
  load-more: the user explicitly asked for a numbered, paginated
  table with a running balance; numbered pages need a total count,
  and the clearing call is all-or-nothing anyway. The ledger-walk cap
  bounds the cost.
