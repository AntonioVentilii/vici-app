# Spec: Onboarding picks persist across every sign-in provider

This spec follows the workflow defined in
`docs/ai/spec-driven-development/workflow.md`.

Status: Implemented (#926)

## Goal

A user's onboarding picks — backed team/country
(`preferences.favoriteParticipantId`), first call
(`preferences.favoriteSide`), handle, and the
`onboardingCompleted` flag — land on the new profile **no matter which
sign-in provider finishes the flow**, including Google. Today they
reliably survive only the in-page providers; a Google sign-up (the
primary, cream-filled provider) silently drops them, which is the
recurring "the country I picked during onboarding isn't saved" report
that prior fixes never closed because they all hardened the write path,
never the path that runs for Google.

## Context

The 3-beat onboarding flow
(`src/lib/components/onboarding/OnboardingFlow.svelte`) holds the picks
as local component `$state`: `participantId` (team/country), `side`,
`handle`. Beat 1a picks the team, 1b the first call, 2 the handle, 3 is
the auth gate (`OnboardingBeat3.svelte` → `SignInProviderStack` with
`mode="signup"`, `onSuccess={onComplete}`).

How picks reach the profile today:

- Beat 3's `SignInProviderStack`
  (`src/lib/components/authn/SignInProviderStack.svelte`) runs the chosen
  provider inside `startSignIn({ run })`, then calls `onSuccess?.()`
  **after `run()` resolves** (line ~93).
- `onSuccess` bubbles to `OnboardingFlow.handleAuthComplete` →
  `onComplete({ participantId, side, handle })` →
  `src/routes/signup/+page.svelte` `handleComplete`. Signed-out at the
  gate, so it routes to `handleCompletePreAuth`, which is the **only**
  writer of `participantId`/`side` into the
  `PENDING_ONBOARDING_STORAGE_KEY` (`vici:pending-onboarding`) stash.
- After sign-in, `(app)/+layout.svelte`'s drain effect (~222) runs
  `drainPendingOnboarding`
  (`src/lib/services/onboarding-handoff.services.ts`), which applies the
  stash to the profile via `applyOnboardingPicks`
  (`src/lib/services/profile.services.ts`) on the **new-user** branch
  (`!profileExisted`).

The write path itself is sound: `applyOnboardingPicks` writes handle +
team + side in one serialized `patchProfile` patch, the satellite
`UserProfileSchema` round-trips `favoriteParticipantId`
(`src/satellite/api-schemas.ts`, `withProfileDefaults` in
`src/satellite/services/profile.services.ts`), and
`calculateAndSyncStats` only patches stat fields — it never touches
`preferences`. So the picks are **not clobbered after being written**.

### Root cause 1 — redirect providers never reach the stash (primary)

Google is configured as a **full-page OAuth redirect**, not a popup
(`SignInProviderStack.onGoogle`, ~137):

```ts
await signIn({
	google: {
		options: {
			redirect: {
				redirectUrl: `${window.location.origin}/auth/callback/google`
			}
		}
	}
});
```

`signIn()` navigates the document to Google, so the `await` never
resolves in this page and `onSuccess?.()` (line ~93) **never fires**.
The picks live in `OnboardingFlow` state, which the redirect destroys.
On return, `src/routes/auth/callback/google/+page.svelte` only finishes
auth (`handleRedirectCallback`) and routes to Flow — it cannot recover
picks that were never stashed. The drain then finds **no pending
payload** (or only a referral/email stashed elsewhere), so team/side
are gone. Handle still _looks_ right because `ensureProfile` seeds a
nickname from the OAuth display name at bootstrap — which is exactly
why the report is always "the country didn't save," not "my handle
didn't save."

Apple proves the pattern: `onApple` calls `onSuccess?.()` **before**
`window.location.assign(Flow)` (~132), so its picks are stashed before
it leaves the page. Google has no equivalent pre-redirect stash.

### Root cause 2 — the drain reads `profileExisted` reactively (hardening)

The drain effect captures `$userStore.profileExisted` at effect-run
time. Svelte effects run async, and `onAuthStateChange`
(`src/lib/components/authn/Authn.svelte`) can fire a second pass; the
2nd `ensureProfile` finds the doc the 1st pass just bootstrapped →
`existed: true` → `userStore.set({ profileExisted: true })`. If that
lands before the drain effect runs, the drain takes the
`account_exists` branch and applies **nothing**. This is a real,
timing-dependent way for even an in-page provider to drop picks, and it
hides behind root cause 1 for Google.

### Reusability

`handleCompletePreAuth` in `signup/+page.svelte` is already the correct,
merge-safe stash writer (it preserves a referral code / email stashed by
`/i/[code]`, `/league/[code]`, or the email provider). The fix reuses
it rather than adding a second stash path.

## Scope

### 1. Stash picks before any sign-in is initiated (primary fix)

Make the onboarding picks durable in `PENDING_ONBOARDING_STORAGE_KEY`
**when the user reaches Beat 3**, before they tap any provider — so a
full-page redirect (Google, and any future redirect provider) can't
carry them off in volatile component state.

- `OnboardingFlow.svelte`: when advancing into Beat 3 (`handleHandle`,
  and on mount if the flow opens straight on a later beat), emit the
  current `{ participantId, side, handle }` through a new
  `onPicksReady` callback. Re-emit whenever the picks change and the
  user returns to Beat 3 (e.g. `handleAuthBack` → edit → forward).
- `signup/+page.svelte`: wire `onPicksReady={handleCompletePreAuth}`.
  This writes the same merge-safe pre-auth stash that `onComplete`
  writes today, but **before** the provider runs. Keep the existing
  `onComplete` wiring unchanged: in-page providers still take the
  authenticated direct-write path (`handleCompleteAuthenticated`), and
  the redirect providers now have a stash waiting for the drain.
- Idempotency: the early stash + a later `onComplete`/drain applying the
  same picks is a no-op re-write of identical values. The authenticated
  direct-write path already stamps `onboardingCompleted: true`; a
  leftover identical stash drained afterward changes nothing.

### 2. Make the drain's new-user decision deterministic (hardening)

Capture "this sign-in bootstrapped the profile" at the moment
`ensureProfile` creates it, sticky for the session, so a second
`onAuthStateChange` pass cannot flip the drain into the
`account_exists` branch.

- `profile.services.ts`: record the principal in a session-scoped
  "bootstrapped this session" set when `ensureProfile` creates a new doc
  (`existed: false`), exposed via a small getter. Cleared on sign-out
  (`Authn.svelte`'s null-user branch, via `forgetBootstrappedThisSession`)
  so a sign-out → sign-in in the same tab is judged fresh and a returning
  user isn't re-run through the new-user branch — the double-pass race
  this guards is within one sign-in (both passes carry a non-null user),
  so clearing on sign-out never reopens it.
- The drain treats a principal bootstrapped this session as new
  regardless of a later racy `getDoc` read. A genuinely returning user
  (doc predates this session) is unaffected — their saved profile is
  still protected. This also subsumes the `signup` page's racy
  `profileExisted` bounce: even if a second pass bounces a new user to
  Flow early, the stash persists and the drain (under the (app) layout)
  still applies the picks — so the `signup` derived needs no change.

### 3. Provider consistency pass

Verify every enabled provider in `SignInProviderStack`
(`apple`, `google`, `email`, `ii`, `passkey`, `dev`) persists the full
pick set end-to-end after the change. Document the per-provider path in
`PRODUCT.md`.

### Out of scope

- The satellite write path, schema, or `assertSetDoc` — confirmed
  correct; no satellite change.
- The pre-`v5` auth migration / AuthClient v7 work
  (`[[project_juno_authclient_v7]]`).
- Anti-farming gating of the onboarding VXP grant (issue #543) — the
  grant path is unaffected by where picks are stashed.
- Eventual-consistency between `ensureProfile`'s bootstrap write and the
  immediate `functions.getProfile` query read in `patchProfile`: noted
  as a known robustness edge (a lagging-replica query could return the
  default shell), but not the cause here and not changed in this PR
  unless a quick guard falls out of the work.

## Linked issues

No open issue tracks this; user-reported 2026-06-17/18 ("the country
chosen during onboarding is not persisted"). New fix, no closing
keyword.

## Analytics

`onboarding_completed` exists in the taxonomy
(`src/lib/types/analytics-event.ts`) but is **not emitted anywhere**
today — the activation milestone is currently uninstrumented, which is
why the Google-vs-other persistence gap was invisible. This spec emits
it, carrying the dimension that would have surfaced the bug:

- the finishing **provider** (`apple | google | email | ii | passkey |
dev`), and
- whether a **team was persisted** (`favoriteParticipantId` non-empty).

Reuse the existing `AnalyticsEventProps` dimensions rather than adding
new prop keys — a new key would churn the satellite analytics wire
schema / declarations (the analytics-variant regen landmine,
`[[reference_analytics_event_is_candid_variant]]`). Map provider →
`label` (the props bag's documented "small categorical label", bounded
vocab) and team-picked → `ok`, with `source: 'onboarding'`. No new
event name, no prop-key addition, so no dual-source TS-union / Zod-mirror
edit and no binding regen.

Emit once, in the drain's `applied` outcome
(`onboarding-handoff.services.ts`). Because the picks are now stashed at
Beat 3 for **every** path (including the authenticated in-page finish,
whose leftover stash the drain still processes idempotently on Flow),
the drain is the single point every completed flow passes through — so
one emit there covers all providers without double-counting. The
provider id rides in the stash (see the provider-capture step). Capture
via `track()` (`src/lib/services/analytics.services.ts`). Behavioural
only — no PII, no free-form text.

## Implementation outline

1. `OnboardingFlow.svelte`: add `onPicksReady?: (picks: {
participantId: string | null; side: 'YES' | 'NO' | null; handle:
string | null }) => void`; call it when entering Beat 3 and whenever
   the picks change while at/returning to Beat 3.
2. `signup/+page.svelte`: pass `onPicksReady={handleCompletePreAuth}`.
   Confirm `handleCompletePreAuth` stays merge-safe (referral/email
   preserved) and is a no-op when there's nothing to stash.
3. `profile.services.ts`: add the session-scoped bootstrapped-principal
   capture in `ensureProfile`; expose a getter.
4. `onboarding-handoff.services.ts` + `(app)/+layout.svelte`: gate the
   `account_exists` branch on the deterministic capture, not solely the
   reactive `profileExisted` flag.
5. Provider capture: in `SignInProviderStack.startSignIn` (and
   `onApple`), merge the chosen provider id into the pending stash
   _before_ `run()` (same single-field merge as `stashPendingEmail`), so
   the drain knows which provider finished even across a redirect.
6. Analytics: emit `onboarding_completed` in the drain's `applied`
   outcome (the single path every completed flow passes through),
   mapping provider → `label`, team-picked → `ok`, `source:
'onboarding'` (no new prop keys).
7. Verify each provider locally (dev + at least one redirect path) that
   a freshly-created profile carries `favoriteParticipantId`,
   `favoriteSide`, and `onboardingCompleted: true`.
8. Update `docs/ai/PRODUCT.md` onboarding section: picks are stashed
   before sign-in so they survive a redirect provider, and the
   new-user decision is session-deterministic.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] A new user who picks a team, makes a first call, and completes
      sign-up **with Google** lands with
      `preferences.favoriteParticipantId` and `favoriteSide` set and
      `onboardingCompleted: true`.
- [ ] The same holds for every other enabled provider (apple, email, ii,
      passkey, dev) — verified path-by-path.
- [ ] A returning user (profile predates this session) is **not**
      re-prompted and their saved profile is **not** overwritten by a
      stale pending payload.
- [ ] A second `onAuthStateChange` pass during a fresh sign-in cannot
      route the drain into `account_exists` and drop picks.
- [ ] A user who edits their handle (Beat 3 → back → Beat 2 → forward)
      re-stashes the updated picks before signing in.
- [ ] `onboarding_completed` carries `provider` and `teamPicked`.
- [ ] `npm run quality` and `npm run check` pass.

## Open questions

- Does Juno's Google `signIn` ever resolve in-page (popup fallback on
  some platforms) such that `onSuccess` _also_ fires? If it can, confirm
  the early stash + a later `onComplete` is still purely idempotent (it
  should be — identical values). Verify against `@junobuild/core`
  behaviour, not assumption.

## Decisions

- **Fix the stash gap, not the write path.** Every prior attempt
  hardened `applyOnboardingPicks` / the drain; the picks for Google
  never reached storage in the first place. Persisting them before the
  redirect is the actual missing link, and it generalizes to any future
  redirect provider.
- **Reuse `handleCompletePreAuth`, fire it earlier.** It is already the
  correct merge-safe stash writer; the bug was _when_ it ran (after a
  redirect that never returns control), not _what_ it wrote.
- **Session-deterministic new-user capture over a reactive flag.** The
  `account_exists` guard must protect genuine returning users without
  being flippable by a benign second auth pass mid-onboarding.
