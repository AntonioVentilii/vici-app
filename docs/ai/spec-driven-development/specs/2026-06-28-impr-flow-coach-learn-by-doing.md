# Spec: Learn-by-doing in-flow gesture coach

This spec follows the workflow defined in
`docs/ai/spec-driven-development/workflow.md`.

Status: Implemented (#1059)

## Goal

The first-run gesture coach (`FlowCoach`, layer 1 of the first-run tutorial
system) becomes a non-blocking gesture map laid over the live prediction
card instead of a timer-driven carousel that dictated pace and animated the
card. The user keeps interacting with the readable, swipeable card and the
coach dismisses on their first real call — teaching by doing rather than
forcing a sequence.

## Context

The coach previously ran a fixed five-phase timeline (NO → YES → SKIP → TAP
→ IDLE on hard-coded timers), tagged the deck's cards with
`data-coach-phase` so they drifted and blurred in sympathy via global CSS,
flipped the card on the TAP beat, and dismissed on any pointer-down. It
taught gestures the user could not yet try and got in the way of the card it
was explaining.

Touchpoints:

- `src/lib/components/onboarding/FlowCoach.svelte` — both surfaces (`flow`
  and `onboarding`). The component owns the new overlay markup and its
  component-scoped styles.
- `src/lib/components/market/FlowMode.svelte` — the deck. It already builds a
  per-commit signal on every committed YES / NO; the coach consumes it.
- `src/app.css` — held the legacy `.flow-coach*` overlay block and the
  `[data-coach-phase]` card-drift rules.
- i18n catalogs under `src/lib/constants/messages/` — held the old
  `flow.coach.hint_*` carousel keys.
- `src/lib/utils/onboarding-flags.utils.ts` — the per-surface, identity-scoped
  seen flags (`vici.coach-flow-seen` / `vici.coach-onboarding-seen`), reused
  unchanged.

## Scope

- Replace the carousel with a static centered gesture map: a heading and a
  cross — SKIP (up), NO (left), tap (center, detail), YES (right) — with
  YES / NO carrying the primary visual weight and SKIP / TAP de-emphasized.
- Make the overlay non-blocking: `pointer-events: none` except the "Got it"
  opt-out button (and the confirm flash).
- Wire dismissal to the deck's first committed call. `FlowMode` exposes its
  per-commit counter as a reactive `commitSignal` prop; the coach snapshots
  it at mount and dismisses on the first increment past that baseline. The
  deck only bumps the counter on a committed YES / NO (reachable only when
  signed in), so for guests the "Got it" opt-out is the dismissal path.
- On the first commit, flash a short confirmation, then unmount; "Got it"
  dismisses immediately, without the flash. Either path persists the seen
  flag.
- Remove the legacy overlay styles, the `data-coach-phase` card-drift rules,
  and the now-unused coach keyframes from `app.css`.
- Replace the `flow.coach.hint_*` keys with a new `flow.coach.*` set
  (head / skip / skip_sub / no / no_sub / yes / yes_sub / tap_sub / got_it /
  confirm, plus the repurposed `aria`) across the live locales; drop the
  orphaned keys from the remaining catalog that carried them.

### Out of scope

- The `onboarding` surface keeps the same redesign and the same first-commit
  dismissal signal; no behavioural divergence between surfaces.
- No change to the funds gate, commit flow, or the per-swipe commit toast.

## Linked issues

No related open issue — this is a fidelity improvement to an existing
surface.

## Analytics

No new analytics. The coach is a passive overlay; the meaningful behavioural
event is the commit itself (`flow_swipe`), already instrumented in the deck.
Adding a coach-shown / coach-dismissed event would not change any product
decision here, so none is added.

## Implementation outline

1. Rewrite `FlowCoach.svelte` as the non-blocking gesture map with the
   confirm flash and "Got it" opt-out; move its styles into a
   component-scoped `<style>` with token colors and a reduced-motion gate.
2. Add a `commitSignal` prop; capture the baseline at mount and dismiss on
   the first increment past it.
3. In `FlowMode.svelte`, make the per-commit counter reactive and pass it as
   `commitSignal`.
4. Delete the legacy `.flow-coach*` and `[data-coach-phase]` rules and the
   unused coach keyframes from `app.css`.
5. Swap the i18n keys across all live catalogs and remove the orphaned
   `flow.coach.hint_*` keys.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] The overlay leaves the card readable and swipeable; only "Got it" is
      interactive.
- [ ] A signed-in user's first committed YES / NO dismisses the coach with a
      brief confirm; "Got it" dismisses immediately without it.
- [ ] Once dismissed by either path, the coach never reappears on that device
      for that identity.
- [ ] No `data-coach-phase` / carousel / timer logic or CSS remains.
- [ ] `npm run check` and `npm run check:i18n` pass.

## Decisions

- The first-call signal is passed as a plain reactive prop rather than a
  shared store or a `window` event: the counter already lives one component
  up in the deck, so a prop is the most direct idiomatic wiring.
- Guests can reach the deck but cannot commit, so their only dismissal path
  is "Got it" — accepted by design rather than special-casing guest copy.
