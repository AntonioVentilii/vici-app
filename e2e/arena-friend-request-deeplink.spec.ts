/**
 * Friend-request inbox deep-link → Friends tab.
 *
 * A `friend_request` inbox notification routes to
 * `/arena?request=<relationId>` (`inbox.store.ts`). `ArenaPage` must force
 * the Friends tab when that param is present so the recipient lands on the
 * Accept affordance instead of whichever Arena tab the URL would otherwise
 * resolve — the iOS "I tapped it and nothing happened" report (#803 / #809).
 *
 * Arena no longer persists the last-viewed tab across sessions (#1038): a
 * plain `/arena` entry always opens Friends, and a back-nav can target a
 * specific tab via `?tab=` (`focusTabKey`). `?request=` outranks `?tab=`, so
 * this seeds an explicit `?tab=leagues` as the non-Friends baseline and
 * asserts `?request=` still wins — that makes the override meaningful rather
 * than coinciding with the Friends default.
 *
 * The dev mock identity mints a fresh principal per run, so seeding a real
 * incoming request between two users isn't deterministic here; this guards
 * the routing the fix adds. The full send→accept path is a manual repro in
 * the PR body (see docs/ai/frontend/testing.md).
