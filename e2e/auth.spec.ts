 * Sign-in flow against the Juno emulator using the dev-only mock identity
 * (`signIn({ dev: {} })`) — the same path Juno's official E2E guide
 * recommends. Real Internet Identity flows can be added in a follow-up;
 * the dev provider exercises the same `onAuthStateChange` pipeline, which
 * is what makes a sign-in / sign-out test useful.
 *
 * A fresh dev principal has no profile, so signing in routes the new user
 * through the `/signup` onboarding beats before the app shell — that's the
 * canonical new-user flow, driven end-to-end by `signInAsDevUser`. Sign-out
 * lives on the Settings page and returns the user to `/signin`.
