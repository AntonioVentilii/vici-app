/**
 * Playwright global setup — runs once before any spec.
 *
 * Confirms the two HTTP endpoints every test depends on are actually
 * reachable before the suite starts:
 *
 * 1. **Vite dev server** (`http://localhost:5173/`) — booted by the
 *    `webServer` block in `playwright.config.ts`.
 * 2. **Juno emulator** (`http://127.0.0.1:5987/`) — booted by the CI
 *    workflow's "Start Juno emulator" step. The emulator is the PocketIC
 *    instance every dev-mode sign-in and every canister query talks to.
 *
 * Without this guard, a missing emulator manifests as 13 identical
 * `Timeout 30000ms exceeded` failures deep inside `home.page.ts`
 * (`getByTestId('user-menu')` never resolves because the satellite
 * round-trip never completes). The error you actually want to see is
 * "the emulator isn't responding". That's what this gives you.
 *
 * Deliberately fast: a couple of HEAD-equivalent fetches with a tight
 * timeout. Adds ~1–2s to a healthy run, fails in ≤6s when something is
 * wrong. Does NOT address the separate "proxy degrades mid-run" flake
 * — that lives in the Vite-↔-PocketIC connection pool and needs a
 * different remedy (see docs/ai/frontend/testing.md).
