/**
 * Invite-link landing smoke tests.
 *
 * `/join/[code]` and `/i/[code]` are twin entrypoints that render the same
 * `InviteLanding`. Before #746, `/join/{slug}` had no route and 404'd — the
 * exact user-facing regression these guard against.
 *
 * Both branches run anonymously and deterministically, with NO referral
 * fixtures required:
 *
 * - A malformed slug is rejected by `REFERRAL_CODE_REGEX`, toasts, and routes
 *   home (`AppPath.Home` = `/app`); the (app) auth gate then bounces the
 *   anonymous visitor to `/signin`.
 * - A well-formed code is stashed for attribution and the visitor is sent to
 *   `/signup` — the code needn't exist, since the signed-out branch stashes
 *   blindly and lets the post-signin drain validate it.
 *
 * A genuine 404 (the pre-#746 behavior) renders SvelteKit's error page and
 * reaches neither `/signin` nor `/signup`, so either assertion fails loud.
