/**
 * Wait for the page chrome AND every initial data fetch to settle before
 * screenshotting:
 *
 * 1. The routed container (`data-tid="app-main"`, set on the
 *    `{#key page.url.pathname}` div in `(app)/+layout.svelte`) has
 *    `in:fade={{ duration: 100, delay: 100 }}` on it. Playwright's
 *    `toBeVisible()` propagates parent opacity — so until we wait for
 *    `opacity: '1'`, every descendant is considered hidden.
 * 2. The account control (`user-menu`) confirms we landed in the signed-in
 *    auth state (and, on the desktop project, that the nav chrome rendered).
 * 3. `networkidle` waits until there's been no network activity for 500ms,
 *    which lets every page's `onMount` data fetch finish rendering before
 *    the screenshot — without this, the snapshot races the data fetch and
 *    ping-pongs between spinners and the loaded view. Treated as best-effort
 *    with a bounded timeout: if a page introduces a sub-500ms recurring
 *    fetch (e.g. a status poll), `networkidle` can never fire, and the
 *    default 30s wait would then turn every signed-in nav test into a 30s+
 *    failure even though the chrome above is already visible and stable.
 *    Bounding the wait lets the snapshot still benefit from the common case
 *    (fetches settle in <5s) without making the suite hostage to any future
 *    always-on background traffic.
