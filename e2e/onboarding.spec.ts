/**
 * Pre-sign-in onboarding (`/signup`) — the one-screen flow:
 *
 *   claim a handle (typed or the pool placeholder) and sign up on a single
 *   surface; the provider stack ungates once the handle is claimable.
 *
 * Types a handle, signs in via the dev mock identity, and asserts the
 * claimed handle survives the handoff onto the new profile.
 *
 * The dev provider resolves `signIn({ dev: {} })` synchronously and fires
 * `onSuccess` before the new profile hydrates, so `/signup`'s
 * `handleCompleteAuthenticated` can't upsert the picks immediately — it
 * falls back to the pending-onboarding stash, which the `(app)` layout
 * drain applies once the profile lands. The handle is also stashed
 * synchronously on the auth-surface pointer-down, so a redirect provider
 * would carry it through too. This test guards that path: the profile hero
 * must show the claimed handle, not the bootstrapped principal default.
 *
 * The dev mock identity is ONE principal for the whole CI run, and every
 * earlier `signInAsDevUser` auto-claims the handle field's pool suggestion
 * and completes onboarding for it — so without a reset this principal is a
 * fully-onboarded returning user and the handoff is (correctly) a no-op. We
 * therefore sign in, hard-delete its profile via the dev-only reset hook, wipe
 * the persisted session in place, then cold-load `/signup` — so the run below
 * exercises a genuine new user.
