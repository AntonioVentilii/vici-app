Backend implements owner Principal, admin set with persistent storage, access control functions, and query endpoints. Frontend adds Admin Management UI with admin list display, add/remove forms, and React Query hooks. All requirements appear to be implemented with evidence across backend/main.mo, frontend AdminPage, and useQueries hooks.",
