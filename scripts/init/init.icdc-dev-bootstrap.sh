# Local-only dev ergonomics for the icdc-core engine.
#
# A registry `--mode reinstall` wipes `eng_0.role_grants`. The intended source of
# truth is Juno's `ROLES` collection, and the `syncRoleToEngineOnSet` satellite hook
# mirrors writes into the registry — but only on writes, not on startup. So after a
# reset the engine's `role_grants` starts empty until role docs are re-saved or
# grants are replayed via `dfx`. Painful on a dev laptop where we reset often.
#
# If `DEV_CREATOR_PRINCIPAL` is set and we're on the local network, grant that
# principal `Creator` + `OracleAdmin` on the Vici engine and add it to
# `VICI_ORACLE_V1.authorized_principals` so `npm run init:icdc` leaves the env
# immediately usable by a signed-in II test user.
#
# This runs **after** `init:icdc-engine` (which registers the engine) and
# `init:registry` (which registers the oracle) — both dependencies must exist
# before we can grant.
#
# This is intentionally out-of-band from Juno (no `roles` doc is written). It is a
# no-op on any non-local network (`staging` / `ic`; see `NETWORK` guard). The
# durable, cross-environment fix is a
# Juno-driven reconcile on the satellite — tracked as future work in
# `docs/engine-integration.md` ("Persistence across registry reinstalls").
#
# Env:
#   DEV_CREATOR_PRINCIPAL — the II/Juno principal to bootstrap. Required; script
#                           exits 0 silently if unset (so the step is safe to wire
#                           unconditionally into `init:icdc`).
#   VICI_ENGINE_ID        — defaults to `eng_0`. Keep in sync with
#                           `src/lib/constants/icdc.constants.ts`.
