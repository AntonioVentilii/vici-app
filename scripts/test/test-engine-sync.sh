# Smoke test for the Vici Engine <-> icdc-core registry integration.
#
# What it verifies (via dfx, no Juno SDK needed):
#   1. The Vici engine exists on the configured registry.
#   2. The engine's `admins` list contains the Juno satellite principal.
#   3. The engine's `allowed_roles` include both `Creator` and `OracleAdmin`.
#   4. `grant_engine_role` works for a sample principal when called by a controller.
#   5. `revoke_engine_role` reverses the grant.
#
# Does NOT exercise the satellite hook path (that requires writing to the Juno
# datastore, which in turn requires a signed Juno SDK client — out of scope here).
# To verify the hook end-to-end, run this script first, then manually:
#   a. Log into the app with an admin account.
#   b. Assign the CREATOR role to a test principal via the admin panel.
#   c. Re-run `scripts/test/test-engine-sync.sh`, which will show that principal
#      in `role_grants` on the Vici engine.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/test/test-engine-sync.sh [--local|--staging]
#
# shellcheck source=scripts/lib/utils.sh
source "$(dirname "$0")/../lib/utils.sh" "$@"
