# translate-markets.sh — bulk-set market translations for markets that already
# exist on the registry, from a deck JSON file.
#
# `deploy-markets.sh` registers markets on-chain (add_series) in their base
# locale; their per-locale title/description/outcomes live off-chain in the Juno
# `MARKET_TRANSLATIONS` collection and are written via the satellite's
# admin-guarded `app_upsert_market_translation` endpoint. This script closes that
# gap in bulk: for every deck row that carries a `translations` object, it
# upserts one translation per locale on the matching registry series.
#
# Expected per-row shape (alongside the usual deck fields):
#   {
#     "title": "Will Brazil win the 2026 World Cup?",   // English — the registry match key
#     "translations": {
#       "it": {
#         "title": "Il Brasile vincerà i Mondiali 2026?",
#         "description": "Si risolve SÌ se il Brasile alza il trofeo...",
#         "outcomes": [{ "id": "yes", "title": "Sì" }, { "id": "no", "title": "No" }]
#       },
#       "es": { "title": "...", "description": "...", "outcomes": [...] }
#     }
#   }
# `outcomes` is optional (defaults to an empty vec). Rows without a non-empty
# `translations.<locale>.title` are skipped for that locale.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/translate-markets.sh <markets-json-file> [--local|--staging|--production]
#   npm run translate:markets -- scripts/data/markets.deck-2026.json --production
#
# Auth: runs as the current dfx identity, which must be a satellite ADMIN — see
# assertAdmin in src/satellite/services/market-translation.services.ts (unlike
# tags, translations are admin-only, not creator-writable).
#
# Locales are validated satellite-side against SUPPORTED_LOCALES; an unsupported
# locale FAILs the upsert (counted, non-fatal). Matching is BY TITLE.

# Capture the deck file (first positional) before utils.sh consumes "$@".
