	/**
	 * FlowEntry — the unified full-bleed frosted entry that sits over the
	 * deck (above the pill-nav) until the session begins.
	 *
	 * One surface, two modes:
	 *  • DECK mode — when there is nothing settled to recap, the entry is a
	 *    brief branded beat, NOT a gate. The deck riffles (three cards fan +
	 *    snap) under the Oracle orb while the first-card fetch resolves, then
	 *    the surface auto-enters the moment the deck is ready and a short
	 *    dwell has elapsed (~800 ms, or 250 ms under reduced motion — just long
	 *    enough for the beat to register). No tap is required; the "Enter
	 *    Flow →" CTA is an optional tap-to-skip that the user can hit early.
	 *  • DIGEST mode — when calls settled since the user's last visit, the
	 *    "while you were away" recap takes over and the surface WAITS for the
	 *    user: outcome-aware framing (net gain → celebratory 56px green net +
	 *    confetti + "keep the run going"; net loss → measured neutral net, no
	 *    confetti, "shake it off"), the actual resolved calls (win/loss list,
	 *    capped at 5 + "+N more"). There is no short auto-enter here — the user
	 *    reads the digest and continues via tap-anywhere or the CTA. A ~30 s
	 *    safety net still prevents an indefinite linger. While the per-row
	 *    market titles are still resolving (catalog and/or translations —
	 *    `digest.titlesLoading`) the recap holds behind the deck beat instead
	 *    of flashing `Unknown Market` rows, and every enter path is blocked so
	 *    the recap can't be skipped unseen; a bounded cap guarantees it still
	 *    shows even if the titles never settle.
	 *
	 * `ready` carries the REAL first-card fetch state, so neither the dwell
	 * auto-enter, the safety auto-enter, nor a tap ever reveals a deck that has
	 * not arrived: while the fetch is in flight the Oracle copy keeps cycling
	 * and the CTA holds its arming state. Entering settles any matured calls
	 * (`onEnter`) and reveals the deck. Reduced-motion + theme safe.
