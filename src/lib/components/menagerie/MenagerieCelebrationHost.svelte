	// App-shell celebration pipeline for the Menagerie trophy layer. Mounted once
	// at the (app) shell so a freshly-crossed tier celebrates on any surface.
	//
	// Responsibilities:
	//   1. Mount the glyph sprite once (every badge across the app references it).
	//   2. Watch the owner's stats; on a genuinely new tier crossing, queue a
	//      celebration. FIRST-EVER load (the `earnedMenagerie` field is absent)
	//      seeds the ledger SILENTLY — no celebration storm for a stocked profile.
	//   3. Persist the celebrated-key ledger so a crossing fires exactly once.
	//   4. Render the reveal, HELD while a Flow character beat is on screen so the
	//      two never collide (card → character beat → trophy).
	//
	// Beyond the stats carried on the profile doc, the host reads the SAME shared
	// `menagerie.derived` snapshot the profile rail + album grid render from —
	// referral count + global rank folded in — so Parrot / Goat / Badger
	// celebrate from exactly the tier the user sees, never a divergent one. The
	// host is always mounted at the (app) shell, so it also hydrates those live
	// signals app-wide; any source that's missing just leaves its animal at
	// baseline. It never blocks the host.

	// Hydrate the shared live signals once per distinct signed-in owner —
	// keyed on the owner rather than fired once at mount, because the host
	// is always mounted and can race auth: a pre-auth load has no principal
	// for the self-rank query and skips that leg, so re-firing when the
	// owner lands lets Goat's rank self-heal app-wide instead of reading
	// baseline until some other surface happens to reload the signals. The
	// initial `undefined` sentinel still fires the signed-out load (global
	// standings need no principal); the service's in-flight dedup keeps
	// concurrent surface mounts single-flight.
