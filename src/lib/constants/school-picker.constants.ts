 * School-picker feature gating.
 *
 * The "add your own university" pass — submit a school + school email,
 * receive a 6-digit code, verify membership. When `true`, the picker
 * exposes the add-your-own CTAs, founder badges, and the empty-state
 * "add" hero, and the submit/verify round-trips call the satellite
 * `submitSchool` / `verifySchoolCode` endpoints (which mail the code via
 * the `vici-courier` relay). When `false`, only the directory browse +
 * fuzzy search + status badges + the always-reachable "use it
 * unverified" path ship.
 *
 * Prerequisites for `true` to actually work in an environment: the
 * satellite functions for that environment must be the build that
 * includes `submitSchool` / `verifySchoolCode`, AND a controller must
 * have set the `app_config/school_relay` doc — otherwise submit fails
 * server-side (gated by the relay config). Confirm both before
 * deploying the frontend with this on.
