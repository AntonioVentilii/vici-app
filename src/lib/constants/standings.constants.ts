/**

 * over the same fetched slice the board already re-ranks:
 *
 *  1. {@link LEADERBOARD_QUALIFY_MIN} — the minimum settled calls a predictor
 *     needs to be *ranked at all*. Below it they are "provisional": shown in a
 *     separate section with progress, never in a ranked slot.
 *  2. The Bayesian-shrinkage score ({@link LEADERBOARD_PRIOR_MEAN} /
 *     {@link LEADERBOARD_PRIOR_WEIGHT}) — even qualified records with thin
 *     histories decay toward the population mean instead of riding a short
 *     lucky streak to #1. Same shape as the league screen's prior-weighted
 *     blend (`league-rank.utils.ts`), kept conceptually aligned.
