/**
 * Total VXP granted per user as the new-user starter (onboarding reserve): a single
 * **1,500 VXP** grant at registration. Sized to ~3 daily goals so a new user can reach their
 * first prediction → resolution → payout loop before hitting any wall.
 *
 * The starter is granted in full on registration (milestone 1). The two call-gated milestones
 * (`m2`/`m3`) are retained at **0** — the payout path skips any milestone whose amount is ≤ 0 —
 * so there is no engagement-gated drip. Making predictions is rewarded by gameplay payouts, the
 * first-call achievement, and the referral bonus instead.
