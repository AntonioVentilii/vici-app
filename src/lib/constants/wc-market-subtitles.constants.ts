/**
 * Curated editorial subtitle lines for the 2026 World Cup tentpole
 * markets. Each entry is a short italic accent line that sits below the
 * question on the Flow front card — e.g. "Five-time champions ·
 * tournament favourite", "Neymar's fitness in doubt · squad locks
 * June 2". Keyed by the canonical market id used in `getFlowQueue` and
 * the satellite metadata (the same id scheme the artwork recipes use).
 *
 * Until the satellite exposes a per-market `subtitle` field on
 * `MarketMetadata`, FlowCard uses this map as the source of truth for
 * WC markets; non-WC markets without a curated entry simply hide
 * the subtitle row (the raw description belongs on the back card
 * under RESOLVES YES IF, not as front-card editorial copy).
 *
 * The `·` separator and `&` join the line's two beats; lines stay terse
 * so they read as an editorial accent rather than a sentence. WC markets
 * without a curated context line fall through to no subtitle (see
 * {@link lookupWcMarketSubtitle}).
