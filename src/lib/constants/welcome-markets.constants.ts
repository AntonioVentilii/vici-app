/**
 * Static demo markets shared by the public `/welcome` landing grid and
 * the pre-sign-in onboarding. Both surfaces render hand-curated
 * "what the live deck feels like" cards; centralising the fixture
 * keeps IDs, categories, and yes-probabilities in lock-step so a tweak
 * here updates both surfaces.
 *
 * `yesProbability` is the source of truth (0–1). `yesPercent` is the
 * pre-rounded integer the landing surface displays directly. Onboarding
 * pulls `yesProbability` because it animates the slider; landing pulls
 * `yesPercent` because it shows the static rounded value.

// demo deck, so it's excluded from this fixture type — that lets
// downstream helpers (e.g. `onboarding.category.<id>.label` keys) stay
// statically narrowed to the six categories that ship onboarding copy.
