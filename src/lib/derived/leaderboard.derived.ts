/**
 * Cached leaderboard with the current user's row overlaid by their
 * locally-known profile. The leaderboard store is populated via
 * `listDocs` against the public profiles collection, so it reflects
 * whatever was last persisted — which may lag behind changes made in
 * this session, or still be the bootstrap shortened-principal fallback
 * if the user never edited their nickname. For the viewer's own row we
 * always have the freshest data in `userStore.profile`, so we splice
 * the live identity (nickname/avatar) and the live display-only
 * performance fields (daily streak/accuracy) in here — the row, podium tile,
 * and mini-profile sheet all read from this single merged source so the
 * viewer sees their own up-to-the-second numbers rather than a stale
 * snapshot.
 *
 * `points` is intentionally NOT overlaid: it is the sort key that
 * defines leaderboard order, and the array's ordering reflects the
 * server snapshot. Overlaying a live `points` value would leave the
 * viewer's row at a stale position while showing a higher/lower VXP
 * number, making `rankOf` report an incorrect index and the podium
 * tile show a rank that disagrees with the displayed score.
