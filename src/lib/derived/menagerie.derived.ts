 * resolve to a different tier across the two surfaces.
 *
 * Goat's global-rank signal comes from `myGlobalRankStore` — the satellite's
 * full-ranking self-rank query — so it resolves for every ranked viewer on
 * every surface, the always-mounted celebration host included. The previous
 * source (the viewer's index in the cached top-50 points leaderboard) only
 * resolved while that window happened to contain them, which is why Goat could
 * read earned on one screen and locked elsewhere. Parrot's referral count
 * comes from the shared `myReferralCountStore`. Both extra signals are
 * hydrated by `loadMyMenagerieSignals` (see `menagerie.services`).
