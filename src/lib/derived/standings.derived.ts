 * record scores below a 45/50 (0.90) record once shrunk — being right
 * *repeatedly* is the score, not a short lucky streak.
 *
 * Uses the raw `winCount / settledCount` ratio (reconstructed as `wins =
 * accuracy_fraction · settled`, here `winCount` directly), NOT the rounded
 * integer `accuracy`, so the blend doesn't compress at the rounding. Returns
 * the prior mean for a zero-settled entry (no evidence at all).
