/**
 * World-Cup mode foundation.
 *
 * Two orthogonal signals back the World-Cup experience:
 *
 * 1. {@link worldCupMode} — the *user's* persisted opt-in. Mirrors the
 *    `worldCupMode` flag on `profile.preferences` (cross-device, written
 *    through `preferencesStore`). It is a pure preference: `true` even
 *    after the event has archived if the user last left it on.
 * 2. {@link featuredEventActive} — the *product's* archive gate. Flips
 *    to `false` once `now` passes the featured event's `archiveAfter_ms`
 *    (the product-set cut-over date; see
 *    `featured-event.constants.ts`). Time-driven, user-independent.
 *
 * Consumers that want "should we render World-Cup content right now"
 * (later: Markets focus, the Dashboard WC tile) read {@link worldCupActive}
 * — the AND of the two — so they never re-derive the gate or reach into
 * the preferences object themselves.
 *
 * On top of the gate sits the retention *arc* — {@link worldCupPhase} —
 * which gradually widens the deck from WC-only back to all categories as
 * the event winds down. It layers on these signals plus the featured
 * event's dates rather than introducing a parallel source of truth.
