/**
 * Account deletion — Proposal 4. FE wrappers around the
 * `listMyBlockingLeagues` query + `deleteMyAccount` update.
 *
 * The deletion flow is two phases on the satellite:
 *
 *  1. **Pre-flight.** `listMyBlockingLeagues` returns the league ids
 *     the caller owns that still have other members. The Settings
 *     page calls this when the user first opens the delete flow so
 *     the "transfer ownership first" prompt is surfaced *before*
 *     they pick a reason and type a note.
 *
 *  2. **Deletion.** `deleteMyAccount({ reason, note, leagueResolutions })`
 *     first applies each league resolution (transfer ownership of, or
 *     disband, an owned league), then writes the anonymous exit-signal
 *     doc and SOFT-deletes the caller's profile. On success the FE drops
 *     auth (`signOut`) so the user lands on the sign-in screen.
 *
 * Both calls go through the satellite's authenticated update / query
 * surface; the caller is the auth principal.
