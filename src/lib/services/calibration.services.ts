/**
 * Builds the Calibration practice deck: finalised Vici-engine binary
 * markets, outcome hidden until the user commits.
 *
 * Our normal market list does not scope by engine — the live Flow / Markets
 * surfaces show every engine's markets. Calibration is different: the
 * reward only mints for Vici-engine (`eng_0`) binary markets, so the deck
 * filters on `engineId` here to avoid arming the user on a card that the
 * server will always reject with `not_vici_market`.
 *
 * "Which markets are resolved" comes from clearing's authoritative
 * `list_settled_series` (scoped to the ViciXp domain) rather than from the
 * activity-log–derived `status`: clearing is the single source of truth for
 * resolution, so a series is in the deck only if it is in that settled set.
 * The market view-models still come from {@link getMarkets} (titles, engine,
 * payoff shape, and the activity-derived outcome label used only to drop
 * un-scoreable cards below).
 *
 * Inclusion gate (all must hold):
 * - settled per `list_settled_series` — the authoritative resolved set;
 * - `engineId === VICI_ENGINE_ID` — matches the server's market gate;
 * - `payoffType === 'Binary'` — the only shape with a YES / NO call;
 * - `outcome` is `'YES'` or `'NO'` — a definite side. A settled market
 *   whose settlement was a cancellation / undetermined outcome carries no
 *   binary side, so the server would return `outcome_undetermined`; we
 *   drop it from the deck rather than surface an un-scoreable card.
 *
 * The mint path is untouched: `claimCalibrationReward` independently
 * validates correctness server-side via `get_settlement_status`, so this
 * change is deck-sourcing only.
 *
 * Per-market dedupe (already-earned markets) is enforced server-side via
 * the award-doc key, returning `alreadyClaimed` — the practice surface
 * advances gracefully on that result rather than pre-excluding here, so
 * the deck never needs the user's full award history to build.
