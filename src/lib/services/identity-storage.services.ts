/**
 * Drop the browser-persisted, identity-scoped caches when the signed-in
 * principal changes to a different *defined* owner (sign-in as a different
 * user, account switch), so one identity's state never bleeds into the next
 * on a shared device. The signed-out (`undefined`) transition does NOT clear
 * — see the note below.
 *
 * Only clears on an actual owner change — NOT on a same-user reload, which
 * would defeat the offline-resilient daily-goal mirror (it exists to survive
 * a refresh after a dropped server write). Scope is local-authoritative state
 * with no server copy to reload from; server-backed caches are handled
 * separately in `Authn`.
 *
 * First observation (no persisted owner yet) counts as a change and clears:
 * that's intentional, so already-affected devices from before this guard
 * shipped get cleaned on the next sign-in rather than keeping their leak. The
 * daily-goal profile reconcile re-establishes the real count immediately.
 *
 * The signed-out transition (`ownerKey === undefined`) is a no-op: it neither
 * clears nor forgets the persisted owner. `onAuthStateChange` emits a transient
 * `null` user during bootstrap *before* the restored session resolves, so
 * clearing here would wipe a returning user's local-authoritative state (e.g.
 * inbox "mark all read") on every single sign-in. Cross-account safety is
 * unaffected: the next *defined* owner is compared against the still-remembered
 * previous owner, so a genuine account switch (A → B) still clears.
