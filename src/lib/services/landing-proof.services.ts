 * anonymous by construction — the pre-auth landing already runs under an
 * initialised satellite (see the root `+layout.svelte`), and public-collection
 * reads need no sign-in, the same path the rest of the marketing surface uses.
 *
 * We never page the full collection: a single `listDocs` with a one-item page
 * returns the total in `ListResults.matches_length` (total matching docs,
 * ignoring pagination), so the cost is one minimal query regardless of how
 * many users exist. This is a genuine, always-non-zero platform-wide figure.
