 * (`LEADERBOARD_LIMIT`) and the ranking authoritative server-side.
 *
 * Nicknames are returned as-is for every row the caller is allowed to
 * see; the broader "who can see whom" gate is owned by the upcoming
 * user-visibility rework.
 *
 * Points are probability-weighted and enhanced by streaks; the actual
 * sort happens satellite-side too so client and server agree on rank.
