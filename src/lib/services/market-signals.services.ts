/**
 * `marketIds` scopes the per-market `followedLean` fan-out to the markets the
 * viewer is actually looking at — the sliced Flow deck, or the single market on
 * a detail page — rather than every tagged series in the catalog. Without it the
 * query both wastes round-trips on markets the viewer can't see and (capped at
 * `MAX_MARKETS`) can drop the lean for markets they *can*. Accepts a promise so
 * Flow can derive it from the still-resolving queue without serialising the
 * deck-independent fetches below.
 *
 * `tagMappings` is an optional pre-fetched input: callers that
 * already hold tags from another fetch (e.g. `prepareFlow` shares
 * them with the queue ranking) can pass them in to avoid a
 * duplicate satellite round-trip.
 *
 * `tradeHistory` is likewise an optional pre-fetched input: callers
 * that already derived the viewer's executed events for another
 * purpose (e.g. `prepareFlow` excludes already-called markets from
 * the deck) pass them in so the certified history round-trip isn't
 * issued twice.
