/**
 * School membership verification — submit + 6-digit code (backend B.1).
 *
 * Thin FE wrapper over the two satellite endpoints:
 *
 *   functions.submitSchool({ name, country?, schoolId?, email, locale })
 *     -> { submissionId }
 *     · the satellite re-runs the `spMatchEmail` domain gate, rate-limits,
 *       mints a `raw_rand` 6-digit code, stores its digest (~30-min TTL +
 *       attempt cap), and mails it via the `vici-courier` relay.
 *
 *   functions.verifySchoolCode({ submissionId, code })
 *     -> { ok, schoolId?, status?, message? }
 *     · on success the satellite attaches the school (bumps the verified-
 *       member count, public at 3) and flips the owner's profile
 *       `schoolStatus`.
 *
 * Both round-trips are wrapped in a hard timeout (mirroring
 * `worlds.services.ts`) so the picker's "Sending…" / "Verifying…"
 * spinners can never hang indefinitely. The call signatures are kept so
 * the picker only has to pass the active `locale`.
 *
 * Reachable only when `SCHOOL_PASS2_ENABLED` is on. Note: in any given
 * environment `submitSchool` also needs the `vici-courier` relay deployed
 * and the `app_config/school_relay` doc set there, otherwise the server
 * returns a "relay not configured" error instead of mailing a code.
