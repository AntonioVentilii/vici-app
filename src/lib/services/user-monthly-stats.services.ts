/**
 * FE service for the per-user, per-month gameplay stats that back the two
 * monthly album awards (sharpest-eye, bold-caller).
 *
 * Populate approach — CLIENT-WRITE (chosen over an `onProfileSet` hook):
 * `calculateAndSyncStats` already fetches the user's full clearing history,
 * so it re-derives each month's counters + consensus samples here and
 * persists them to the caller's own `USER_MONTHLY_STATS[${owner}/${YYYY-MM}]`
 * row. This mirrors the proven `USER_STATS` client-write + assert pattern.
 * Juno has no scheduler, so the month rollover is lazy: a new month's doc is
 * simply written under a new key the first time a sync runs in that month,
 * and `getMonthlyLeaderboard` aggregates whatever docs exist for the
 * requested month.
 *
 * Integrity trade-off: the satellite assert (`assertSetUserMonthlyStats`)
 * restricts writes to the caller's own row and enforces structural sanity
 * (`monthWins <= monthCalls`, bounded consensus array, values in [0, 1]), but
 * it does NOT re-derive the counters from real history — a determined user
 * could inflate their own monthly numbers. The award carries no VXP payout
 * (cosmetic album tile), so this matches the existing `user_stats` posture
 * rather than warranting a server-side recompute.
