 * its write can fail (offline, satellite rejection, sandboxed/IC asset host
 * with no reachable backend). Without a fallback, a failed persist would roll
 * the optimistic `userStore` write back and the user's freshly-picked face
 * would silently revert. This cache holds the committed picks for the rest of
 * the session so an edit never vanishes mid-session even when the persist
 * never lands. It is intentionally module-scoped (lives for the page session,
 * cleared on reload) and never written to disk.
 *
 * Keyed to the committing account's `owner` (principal text) so it only ever
 * applies to the account that made the edit. Without the key, a sign-out /
 * sign-in (or switching to a different account that never saved parts) would
 * resolve {@link myAvatarParts} to the previous account's cached face — a
 * cross-account state leak, and permanently wrong for accounts with no saved
 * picks. The serialized form is stored so the parse only re-runs on change.
