/**
 * Client-only guest session. A visitor who takes the "preview first, sign up
 * later" path out of onboarding becomes a guest: they can predict in Flow with
 * no account, no balance, and no wall, and their picks are a throwaway,
 * in-session preview that powers the conversion nudges only.
 *
 * Everything here is preview state, persisted to `localStorage` so a reload
 * keeps the funnel coherent and never written to the satellite (a session with
 * no principal has no doc). It is **cleared on conversion and whenever a real
 * authenticated session is detected** (both in `GuestSaveHost`) — preview
 * picks are discarded, never turned into positions, and the converted member
 * starts with an empty portfolio.
 *
 * `sessionPickCount` is session-scoped on purpose (it mirrors the count, not a
 * lifetime call total) so a returning guest never re-fires the first-pick
 * celebration. It is the source for the soft/remind/inline cadence.
