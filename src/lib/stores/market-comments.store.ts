 * `MarketDiscussion`. `Map.has(marketId)` doubles as the "already loaded
 * once" flag — an empty list is still a valid cached result.
 *
 * Per-market caching (rather than a single shared list) keeps memory bounded
 * to "markets the user has actually opened" and lets us invalidate exactly
 * one entry after a comment is posted / voted on.
 *
 * Keyed by raw `string` (not `MarketId`) because `Comment.marketId` is also
 * a raw string — the discussion subsystem doesn't carry the branded type.
