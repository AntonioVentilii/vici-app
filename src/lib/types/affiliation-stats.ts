/**
 * A single affiliation's standings row for a Worlds kind — two parallel
 * windows, lifetime and monthly.
 *
 * It is used in two ways:
 *
 *  - **Live** (all-time board + current-month column + detail page): recomputed
 *    on read over the affiliation's current opted-in roster
 *    (`cohort.services` — `aggregateMembersLifetime` for the lifetime window,
 *    `aggregateMembersForMonth` for the current month). Nothing is persisted;
 *    a member who leaves or opts out simply drops out of the next read.
 *  - **Frozen** (a closed month's podium + champion cup): persisted once as an
 *    immutable snapshot doc keyed
 *    `${kind}/${affiliationIdentifier}/${monthAnchor}` under `AFFILIATION_STATS`
 *    (see {@link affiliationStatsSnapshotKey}). The Worlds podium freeze writes
 *    it (as a controller) the first time that month is claimed, capturing the
 *    ranking over the then-current opted-in roster so awards / cups stay
 *    stable. On a frozen row the lifetime fields mirror the monthly ones (the
 *    row is scoped to that month).
 *
 * `AFFILIATION_STATS` is write-`controllers`; `assertSetAffiliationStats`
 * enforces snapshot-key-only + write-once as defence in depth.
