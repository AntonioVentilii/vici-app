/**
 * Worlds affiliations — a user's self-selected university and /
 * or country. Carries the signature 90-day lock: once you pick an
 * affiliation, you can't switch for 90 days. This
 * prevents users from chasing the Worlds leaderboard by hopping
 * between schools / nations mid-season.
 *
 * Distinct collection from `league_members` so the lock doesn't
 * leak into user-created leagues (those have free leave + kick).
 *
 * Doc key: `${memberPrincipal}/${kind}/${affiliationIdentifier}`
 * so a user can hold one university + one country row
 * simultaneously. A second write at the same `(member, kind)` after
 * the lock expires is a valid update (the user picks a new school);
 * during the lock window the delete-assert blocks the implicit
 * "leave-then-rejoin" path.
 *
 * Field naming note: `affiliationIdentifier` (not `affiliationId`).
 * Juno's `JsonData` derive macro auto-wraps `Option<NestedStruct>`
 * fields in a `#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]` mirror, but the
 * serde camelCase rename + something about the `Id` tail produced a
 * Candid type whose field name didn't round-trip back to the
 * snake_case wire — every `listMyAffiliations` call trapped with
 * `missing field 'affiliationId'`. Spelling it out as `*Identifier`
 * sidesteps the rename quirk.
