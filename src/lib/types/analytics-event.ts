/**
 * Product analytics event taxonomy — the typed contract every captured
 * event is validated against (cockpit spec DQ-1, "versioned event
 * taxonomy"). This is the source-of-truth TS half of a dual-source pair:
 * the runtime Zod mirror lives in `lib/schema/analytics-event.schema.ts`
 * and MUST be kept in sync (svelte-check only catches the union; an enum
 * mismatch fails at runtime).
 *
 * Design rules:
 *  - Events are **behavioural**, never personal data. Names + a bounded
 *    dimensional `props` vocabulary only — no free-form text, no PII.
 *  - Events are written to YOUR satellite (the `events` collection), not
 *    to any third party. Nothing leaves your infrastructure.
 *  - Identity is the pseudonymous `principal`, optional (absent before
 *    sign-in; stitched from `sessionId` on auth — cockpit ENG-1).
 *
 * Names are snake_case string literals by convention (matches the
 * cockpit's DQ taxonomy + general analytics norms), not TS identifiers.
