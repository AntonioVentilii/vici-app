/**
 * Social cohorts — battles.
 *
 * A battle is a time-bound competition between two parties:
 *
 *   - `league` — leagueA vs leagueB. Either league's owner can
 *     propose; the other league's owner accepts. The score is each
 *     league's prediction accuracy over the battle window, computed by
 *     the satellite from the delta of its `league_stats` counters
 *     between kickoff and settle (no human enters a score).
 *
 *   - `duel` — proposer principal vs challenger principal. Same
 *     state machine, simpler auth (both principals are explicit
 *     on the doc). Duels have no `league_stats` to delta, so they are
 *     out of scope for auto-resolution for now.
 *
 * State machine (forward-only):
 *
 *   proposed → accepted → in_flight → resolved
 *
 * Each transition is gated by the satellite assert on caller +
 * current state. Kickoff stamps each side's baseline counter snapshot;
 * resolve computes scores from the window delta and derives the
 * winner. The assert re-derives both from `league_stats` so a
 * hand-crafted write cannot post a false score.
