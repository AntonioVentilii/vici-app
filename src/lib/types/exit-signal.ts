/**
 * Churn-feedback log written when a user deletes their account.
 *
 * The delete-account flow asks the leaving user to pick
 * one of six reasons and optionally leave a short note. We persist
 * those signals so the team can read churn trends without keeping
 * any handle on who left — the doc has **no principal field** and
 * its key is a random UUID, so the row outlives the account that
 * generated it while staying unlinkable.
 *
 * Doc lifecycle:
 *  - Written exactly once by `deleteMyAccount` before the cascade
 *    hard-deletes the caller's profile + identity-keyed rows.
 *  - Never edited (the assert rejects writes when `current` is
 *    non-null).
 *  - Never deleted (no delete assert handler — admin-only via
 *    direct console access if a future privacy request lands).
