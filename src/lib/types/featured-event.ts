/**

 * Flow filter, Worlds battles hook, archive cut-off) reads from a single
 * `FeaturedEvent` instance so the next tentpole plugs in by swapping the
 * constant — no scattered `cat === 'wc'` checks across screens.
 *
 * See `featured-event.constants.ts` for the current instance and
 * `featured-event.derived.ts` for the active/archived derivation.
