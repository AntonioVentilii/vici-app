/**
 * Lightweight document model for the public `/info/[slug]` routes —
 * Terms, Privacy, Resolution Rules, FAQ, Contact, How resolution works.
 *
 * Block-based on purpose: legal / help copy iterates across sections of
 * heading + paragraph + list, and storing them as structured data (vs.
 * a raw HTML string) keeps each block consistently styled by the renderer
 * across documents.
 *
 * Each text-bearing block, and the doc title / eyebrow, accepts EITHER an
 * i18n key OR a literal string:
 *
 *  - **Keyed copy** (`key` / `itemKeys` / `titleKey` / `eyebrowKey`) is the
 *    localized help docs (FAQ, Contact, How resolution works, Resolution
 *    rules) — referenced by `MessageKey` and resolved per-locale at render
 *    time via `t(...)`, so it mirrors across every live catalog.
 *  - **Literal copy** (`text` / `items` / `title` / `eyebrow`) carries the
 *    full English controlling text of the legal docs (Terms, Privacy). Legal
 *    bodies are kept out of the i18n catalogs by design — the live locales
 *    must mirror `en.ts` exactly and only English exists for these — so they
 *    live as literal-text constants instead.
 *
 * Contact addresses are never translatable copy: `mail` block text and the
 * `{email}` params some paragraphs interpolate come from `contact.constants`.
