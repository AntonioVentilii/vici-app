/**
 * Per-league rolling stats. One doc per league under the
 * `LEAGUE_STATS` collection, keyed by `leagueId`.
 *
 * The doc tracks lifetime counters only — no monthly snapshots,
 * because the tournament uses arbitrary 7-day round windows (not
 * month boundaries), so a monthly anchor would be the wrong frame.
 * Instead, the tournament-resolution endpoint snapshots a league's
 * `(totalCalls, wins)` into the match doc when the league is first
 * assigned to a bracket slot, and reads the current rolling doc at
 * resolution time; the per-window accuracy is the delta between the
 * two. Battles use the same snapshot-delta over a per-battle window.
 *
 * Writes are gated by `assertSetLeagueStats`: only the stats hook
 * (signing as the user whose `USER_STATS` just updated) can write, and
 * only against leagues the caller is a member of. The hook's
 * recipient-binds-caller invariant matches the pattern used by
 * `AFFILIATION_STATS`.
