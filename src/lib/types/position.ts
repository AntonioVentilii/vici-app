/**
 * Synthesized record for a position the user already settled. The clearing
 * canister removes settled `Position` rows during settlement and emits one
 * `EventType::Settled` event per position with the signed cashflow as `qty`;
 * this type is what the FE assembles from those events so the Portfolio,
 * market-detail, and inbox surfaces can render a resolution outcome the same
 * way they used to render live positions.
 *
 * `realizedPnlUsd` is in `USD_DECIMALS` units (matches `Position.lockedCollateral`)
 * so it can flow into existing PnL formatters without conversion.
 *
 * `outcomeId` is only known precisely when the user *won* — in that case it
 * equals `market.outcome`. For losers we leave it `undefined` because a
 * single Settled event can't disambiguate which losing outcome the user held
 * (a categorical-loser could have been on any non-winning outcome).
