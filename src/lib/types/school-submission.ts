/**
 * School-email verification submissions — backend item B.1.
 *
 * One doc per pending (member, email, school) verification attempt, in
 * the server-owned `school_submissions` collection. The satellite is the
 * ONLY writer (the collection is controllers-scoped); a client never
 * reads or writes these directly. The doc never stores the plaintext
 * 6-digit code — only an `FNV-1a(code|salt)` digest, mirroring the
 * existing referral code-generation idiom (the Sputnik runtime exposes
 * no cryptographic hash). The plaintext code lives only in the email
 * and the single outbound HTTPS-outcall body to `vici-courier`.
 *
 * The doc key (see {@link schoolSubmissionKey}) doubles as the opaque
 * `submissionId` handed back to the FE. It carries a per-send random
 * nonce so every send is an IMMUTABLE new row — a resend never overwrites
 * a prior attempt (in particular it can't clobber an already-`verified`
 * row back to `awaiting` and undercount a school). Spam is bounded by the
 * per-principal / per-email daily rate limit instead. The `${member}/`
 * prefix authorizes verification (only the owner can verify) and scopes
 * the rate-limit + registry scans; the `${schoolId}/` segment scopes the
 * "has this member already verified this school?" check.
