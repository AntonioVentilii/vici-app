/**
 * School registry + app runtime config — backend item B.1.
 *
 * Two server-owned shapes that back email-verified university membership:
 *
 *  - {@link SchoolDoc} — one row per verified school in the `schools`
 *    collection, keyed by `schoolId`. Holds the running
 *    `verifiedMemberCount` and the public/pending gate. Written ONLY by
 *    the satellite's `verifySchoolCode` (controllers-scoped write); read
 *    is public so picker surfaces can eventually list public schools.
 *  - {@link AppConfigDoc} — the `app_config` collection (controllers
 *    read+write) holding non-repo runtime config. The
 *    {@link APP_CONFIG_SCHOOL_RELAY_KEY} doc carries the `vici-courier`
 *    base URL + bearer token, set by a controller after deploy so no
 *    secret ever lands in git. (Node operators can read canister state,
 *    so this is a deliberately low-value, instantly-rotatable token whose
 *    blast radius is bounded by the courier's scoping + rate limits.)
