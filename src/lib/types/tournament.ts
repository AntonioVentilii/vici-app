/**
 * Monthly tournament — Proposal 3 in `docs/backend-proposals/README.md`.
 *
 * The TournamentBattleDetail surface presents a 16-league single-
 * elimination bracket with per-match accuracy. We model the structure
 * as two collections:
 *
 *  - **`TOURNAMENTS`** — one doc per monthly tournament. Doc key is
 *    the month anchor (`YYYY-MM`) so a single draw per month is
 *    enforced by the datastore (re-running the draw collides on key).
 *  - **`TOURNAMENT_MATCHES`** — one doc per (tournament, round,
 *    match-index). Keyed `${tournamentId}/${round}/${index}` so the
 *    bracket reads as a single prefix scan.
 *
 * Per locked decisions:
 *
 *  - 3.1 — entry criterion: top-16 leagues by member count. The
 *    aggregator scans LEAGUE_MEMBERS, counts rows per leagueId,
 *    sorts desc, takes the first 16.
 *  - 3.2 — round windows: 7 / 7 / 7 / 7 days (Round 1 → Final).
 *  - 3.3 — minimum 50 calls per league per match to qualify; a
 *    league that falls short forfeits the match.
 *  - 3.4 — forfeit ⇒ opponent advances. If both forfeit, the
 *    lower-seed advances (deterministic for tie-break parity with
 *    the seed order).
 *
 * Bracket seeding follows standard single-elim where seed 1 plays
 * seed 16, seed 2 plays seed 15, etc. This produces the
 * conventional "highest seed meets lowest seed" first-round matchup.
