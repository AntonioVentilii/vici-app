/**
 * Per-user, per-month gameplay stats. One doc per `${owner}/${YYYY-MM}`
 * under the `USER_MONTHLY_STATS` collection. Drives the two monthly
 * album awards:
 *
 *  - **sharpest-eye** — the month's top-3 by accuracy among users with at
 *    least {@link MONTHLY_MIN_CALLS} resolved calls (gold / silver / bronze).
 *  - **bold-caller** — the month's best accuracy among users whose *median*
 *    consensus-at-call is below {@link BOLD_CALLER_MEDIAN_THRESHOLD} (i.e.
 *    they habitually back sides the market thinks are unlikely).
 *
 * The doc is written client-side from `calculateAndSyncStats` (which already
 * fetches the user's full clearing history): the FE re-derives the current
 * and prior calendar month's counters from settled events and persists each
 * month's doc to the caller's own row. This mirrors the proven `USER_STATS`
 * client-write + assert pattern — Juno has no scheduler, so the month
 * rollover is lazy (a new month's doc is simply written under a new
 * `${owner}/${YYYY-MM}` key on the first sync of that month) and `getMonthly
 * Leaderboard` aggregates whatever per-user docs exist for the requested
 * month. The `assertSetUserMonthlyStats` guard restricts writes to the
 * caller's own row and enforces structural sanity (`monthWins <= monthCalls`,
 * the consensus array is bounded). It does NOT verify the counters against
 * real history — same integrity trade-off as `USER_STATS`.
