/**
 * Categories of server-fired VXP award. Each maps to a separate satellite
 * trigger:
 *
 *  - `streak`        — daily-call streak hits a milestone (3 / 7 / 14 / 30).
 *  - `calibration`   — recovering user (available balance below the
 *                      recovery floor) correctly called a finalised Vici
 *                      binary market. One reward per market.
 *  - `referral`      — referrer is credited on a referee's onboarding
 *                      completion. Capped per calendar month.
 *  - `worlds_podium` — recipient's school finished top-3 in the monthly
 *                      battle. Awarded at month rollover.
 *  - `achievement`   — an Album achievement was unlocked for the first
 *                      time; mints the achievement's catalog XP value as
 *                      real VXP. One-time per account (the
 *                      `unlockedAchievements` array is append-only).
 *  - `comeback`      — one-time top-up for a returning user whose stack
 *                      ran dry (away ≥ N days, balance below the floor).
 *  - `flow_milestone` — user's lifetime call count crossed a volume
 *                      milestone (10 / 100 / 500 / 1000). Once per
 *                      threshold ever.
 *  - `flow_overtime` — user reached 15+ calls in a UTC day (overtime
 *                      finish). Once per UTC day.
 *  - `league_founder` — user founded a league. One reward per league they
 *                      own (keyed by league id), capped per account.
