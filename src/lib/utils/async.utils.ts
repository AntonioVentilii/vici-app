/**
 * Race a promise against a hard timeout. Resolves/rejects with the
 * operation if it settles first; otherwise rejects with a labelled
 * `Error` after `timeoutMs`.
 *
 * Use this to bound any IC call (read or update) whose UI shows a
 * spinner — a call that never resolves *and* never rejects leaves the
 * spinner stuck and the caller's `finally` cleanup unreachable. The
 * `label` flows into the error message so the failure is attributable in
 * logs.
 *
 * Note: this does not cancel the underlying `operation` (promises aren't
 * cancellable) — it only stops the caller waiting on it. The timeout
 * timer is always cleared once the race settles, so a winning operation
 * doesn't leave a dangling `setTimeout` keeping the event loop alive
 * (matters in SSR / tests).
