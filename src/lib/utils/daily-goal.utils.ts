 * flight, so the freshly-read profile can lag the optimistic mirror. Taking
 * the max closes that window: on re-entry the count never reads below what
 * the user already committed, so the daily hard cap can't be re-opened by
 * bouncing in and out of Flow.
 *
 * `max` only ever RAISES the count, so it still can't reset the cap: a
 * cleared client has no mirror and falls back to the server value; a
 * hand-edited lower mirror is ignored in favour of the higher server value;
 * a stale-day mirror rolls over to 0 and drops out. When neither source has
 * a today-count the result is 0 (a genuine fresh day).
 *
 * The reconciled count is written back to the mirror only when it advances
 * it, so a later entry without a hydrated profile still gates on the
 * freshest known count. Reads and (conditionally) writes the mirror.
