 * A market id parked when the viewer opens a shared prediction link

 * downstream — a market the viewer already called is never pinned (see
 * `prepareFlow`).
 *
 * Persisted (not in-memory) because the handoff has to survive the detail
 * page, sign-in, and — for a brand-new user — the whole onboarding flow
 * before Flow ever opens. localStorage, reusing `storage.utils`, for parity
 * with the other persisted Flow keys (`vici.flow.daily-goal.v1`). Consumed
 * (cleared) on the first read so it pins exactly once, and TTL-bounded so a
 * link opened-and-forgotten in an earlier session never hijacks a later
 * organic Flow entry.
