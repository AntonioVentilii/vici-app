/**
 * The single definition of "rank within a league". Every surface that shows
 * a member's league position — the leagues-list card badge, the detail-page
 * hero, and the detail-page leaderboard list — ranks through here, so the
 * three can never disagree.
 *
 * The order is accuracy-first: prediction accuracy (win rate) descending,
 * tie-broken on the longer active streak, then on join order (oldest first)
 * for a stable result. A member yet to settle a prediction sits at 0% and
 * sinks to the foot rather than riding join order or role to the top. This
 * mirrors the global leaderboard and is window-independent — the accuracy
 * figure is a single lifetime value, identical on the week and all-time
 * tabs.
 *
 * Accuracy/streak are read through caller-supplied accessors (the component
 * owns the profile cache) and snapshotted once per member before the sort,
 * so the O(n log n) comparator never re-reads the cache on every pass.
