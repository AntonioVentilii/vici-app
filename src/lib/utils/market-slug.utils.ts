 * Keyword slugs for the `/m/{param}` share alias.
 *
 * A share link used to carry the bare 64-hex series id — zero keyword
 * signal for search engines and unreadable in chats. The slugged form
 * (`will-brazil-beat-norway~007c6578`) keeps the question in the URL while
 * the short id suffix pins the exact market:
 *
 *   - Registry titles are immutable, so a slug derived from one is stable
 *     forever — but two titles can normalize to the same slug. The 8-hex
 *     suffix makes the param unique *by construction*, with no deploy-time
 *     collision bookkeeping and no coordination between the share sheet
 *     (which only has one market in hand) and the SEO generator (which has
 *     the whole catalog).
 *   - `~` separates slug from suffix: URL-unreserved (RFC 3986), never
 *     produced by the slug alphabet (`a-z0-9-`), never part of a hex id.
 *
 * Resolution order for an incoming param lives in the `/m/[id]` route: an
 * id embedded by the deploy-time SEO page wins, then a full-hex param
 * (legacy links), then the `~` suffix matched against the catalog.
 *
 * Shared by the FE share sheet and `scripts/build/generate-seo-assets.ts` —
 * both sides must produce the identical param for the same market, or
 * shared links and the emitted crawler pages stop agreeing on URLs.
