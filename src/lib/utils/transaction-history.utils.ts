 * when VXP merely shifts between "available" and "in play":

 * - `Executed` (a fill) reserves margin but is wealth-neutral: the staked VXP
 *   is still the user's, just locked. Its delta is `0`; the committed margin
 *   rides on the row as `stake` for display.
 * - `Settled` / `Liquidated` realize the position. The signed `qty` is the
 *   realized cashflow (see `settledEventToResolvedPosition`) — a win adds the
 *   profit, a full loss subtracts the stake, a break-even nets zero — and
 *   that cashflow *is* the total delta. No margin-release term is needed,
 *   because the fill never debited total in the first place.
 *
 * `OrderPlaced` (a resting order) reserves margin too but, like a fill,
 * leaves total untouched — so it contributes no delta and renders no row.
 * This is what lets the total-anchored walk reconcile to a clean zero genesis
 * even with orders still resting: a spendable-anchored walk drifted the
 * oldest balances negative by exactly that reserved-but-unrepresented amount.
