/**
 * Compute the *net* VXP a user would gain on a winning call.
 *
 * Formula:
 *
 *   payout_on_win = stake / max(P_WIN_FLOOR, p_win)
 *   net_win       = payout_on_win − stake
 *
 * The floor on `p_win` caps long-shot payouts at ~20× stake; without it
 * a 1% side would pay 100× and deplete the economy.
 *
 * Returns the *true* net, which can be **below 1** for a heavy favourite:
 * the server settles the raw `stake·(1/price − 1)` cashflow (minus a small
 * fee) with **no** payout floor, so a 0.99 side on a 50 stake really nets
 * ~0.5 VXP. We deliberately do **not** round or floor here — that would
 * over-promise a "+1" the settlement never credits (see issue #188). The
 * caller decides display granularity via `formatWholeVxpMagnitude`, which
 * renders a sub-1 win as `<1` rather than rounding it to a misleading `+1`
 * or a broken `+0`. The ~0.15% settlement fee is not modelled here — it is
 * a known, negligible gap (the FE shows `<1` rather than over-promising a
 * `+1` the settlement won't credit).
