/**
 * Account deletion — Proposal 4 in `docs/backend-proposals/README.md`
 * (Delete account v2: soft-delete + recovery + admin sweep, with
 * league resolution).
 *
 * `deleteMyAccount` runs four steps in order:
 *
 *  1. **League resolution.** If the caller passes `leagueResolutions`,
 *     each is applied IMMEDIATELY before the blocking guard — a
 *     `transfer` reuses {@link transferLeagueOwnershipFn} (hand the
 *     league to another member), a `delete` reuses {@link
 *     deleteLeagueFn} (disband the league entirely). Only leagues the
 *     caller actually owns are acted on; a resolution targeting a
 *     league the caller doesn't own is ignored (the blocking guard
 *     below decides whether that leaves a blocker). If any resolution
 *     fails, the WHOLE delete aborts with `reason:
 *     'league_resolution_failed'` (plus `failedLeagueId` +
 *     `resolutionReason`) and NOTHING further runs — but resolutions
 *     applied before the failure have already committed (see the
 *     recovery caveat below).
 *
 *  2. **Owner-leagues guard.** If, after resolution, the caller still
 *     owns any league that has another member, the deletion is refused
 *     with `reason: 'owns_non_empty_league'`. The FE surfaces a
 *     "transfer ownership first" prompt (decision 4.3).
 *
 *  3. **Soft-delete.** The caller's profile gets `deletedAtMs = now`
 *     (decision 4.1, soft-delete preserves the audit trail). NO data
 *     is removed — recovery must be able to restore the full account.
 *     The nickname is left untouched so the handle stays reserved
 *     (`checkNicknameAvailability` scans every profile doc). A second
 *     soft-delete keeps the EARLIEST `deletedAtMs` so the recovery
 *     clock can't be reset by re-deleting, and reports
 *     `alreadyDeleted` to drive step 4's idempotency.
 *
 *  4. **Exit-signal write.** A single `EXIT_SIGNALS` doc is appended
 *     with the chosen reason + optional note. The doc has no
 *     principal field — it's intentionally unlinkable from the
 *     account that wrote it. Skipped when step 3 reports
 *     `alreadyDeleted` (a re-delete inside the recovery window), so a
 *     repeated `deleteMyAccount` can't over-count churn.
 *
 * After this returns ok the FE drops auth (`signOut`). The principal
 * can `recoverMyAccount` within {@link ACCOUNT_RECOVERY_WINDOW_MS};
 * past that window the data is hard-deleted (lazily, on a too-late
 * recovery attempt, or eagerly by the admin `sweepExpiredDeletions`).
 *
 * The hard-delete cascade itself lives in {@link hardDeleteAccountFn},
 * parametrised by principal so the sweep can run it for any account.
 *
 * **Recovery caveat (deliberate, not a bug).** League resolutions are
 * applied IMMEDIATELY (a real transfer / disband), matching the
 * delete-v2 contract — they are NOT deferred to the hard-delete. So a
 * user who soft-deletes while resolving leagues and then
 * `recoverMyAccount`s within the recovery window gets their ACCOUNT
 * back but NOT the relinquished leagues: a transferred league now
 * belongs to its new owner, a deleted league is gone. Recovery
 * restores identity-keyed rows (profile, awards, relations, …), never
 * the league-ownership decisions the user explicitly made at delete
 * time.
