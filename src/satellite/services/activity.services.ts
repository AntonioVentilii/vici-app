/**
 * Write-time guard for the `activities` collection. The collection is public-write (it's the social
 * feed), and several server flows now read it — the onboarding milestones and the referral
 * first-prediction payout both key off a caller's `trade` activity. Without a guard a client could
 * `set_doc` an activity attributed to **another** principal (feed spoofing) or under a malformed
 * key. This assert binds every activity to its writer:
 *
 *  - `data.user` (the actor) MUST equal the caller — no writing activity as someone else.
 *  - `type` must be a known {@link ActivityType}.
 *  - the doc key must be `${caller}#${timestamp}#${type}` (the shape `logActivity` writes), so the
 *    owner-scoped reads + the `#trade`-suffix matcher used by the payout gates stay trustworthy.
 *
 * NOTE: this stops impersonation, not a user self-faking their *own* `trade` to trigger their own
 * reward — that requires verifying an authoritative cleared trade on the engine (tracked in #543).
