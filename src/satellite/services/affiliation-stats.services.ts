/**
 * Pre-write guard for `affiliation_stats`.
 *
 * The collection is now write-`controllers` and holds **only** immutable
 * frozen monthly snapshots — one per `(kind, affiliationIdentifier, monthAnchor)`,
 * keyed `${kind}/${affiliationIdentifier}/${monthAnchor}` (3 segments). They are
 * written by the Worlds podium freeze (`vxp-worlds-podium.services`) as a
 * controller at the moment a closed month's podium is first claimed, capturing
 * the ranking over the then-current opted-in roster. The live windows
 * (all-time, current month) are recomputed on read from the roster and are
 * never persisted here.
 *
 * This assert is defence in depth on top of the controllers-only write rule:
 *
 *  1. **Collection scope.** No-op for any other collection.
 *  2. **Snapshot key only.** The key must equal the canonical snapshot key for
 *     the doc's `(kind, affiliationIdentifier, monthAnchor)`. Rolling
 *     (2-segment) keys are no longer written and are rejected.
 *  3. **Write-once.** A frozen month is immutable history — any write over an
 *     existing snapshot is rejected.
 *  4. **Counter sanity.** Non-negative, and `wins ≤ totalCalls` /
 *     `monthWins ≤ monthTotalCalls` on both windows.
