/**
 * League-battle resolution from real settled-call history (controller-trusted).
 *
 * A league battle scores each side on its members' prediction accuracy over the
 * battle window. The figure is read straight from the clearing canister's
 * settlement events — the on-chain source of truth for what actually settled —
 * via {@link aggregate_settlement_accuracy}, never from a client-written
 * counter. Because an assert cannot make the inter-canister call to re-derive
 * the score, resolution is **controller-trusted**: this endpoint (running as the
 * satellite) computes the scoreline and writes the resolved doc as a controller,
 * and {@link assertSetBattle} accepts an `in_flight → resolved` league write
 * only from a controller. A client cannot forge a result.
 *
 * Membership is read at resolve time (the league's *current* members), which is
 * also the liveness model: Juno has no scheduler, so a settled battle resolves
 * the first time any member of either side opens it and the FE calls this.
