/**
 * Pre-write guard for `exit_signals`. The collection is an anonymous
 * append-only churn-feedback log written by `deleteMyAccount` right
 * before the cascade hard-deletes the caller's identity. The shape
 * rules here:
 *
 *  1. **Append-only.** `current` must be null. A doc is written
 *     once and never touched again — there's no edit flow, and a
 *     blocked edit attempt is a clearer error than a silent data race.
 *  2. **Shape.** `reason` must be one of the six picker buckets the
 *     prototype's UI exposes (mirrored in `EXIT_SIGNAL_REASONS`).
 *     `note` must be a string ≤ {@link EXIT_SIGNAL_NOTE_MAX_LENGTH}.
 *     `createdAtMs` must be finite + positive.
 *  3. **Anonymous shape.** We don't validate any principal field — the
 *     doc body has none. The key (random UUID, chosen by the caller)
 *     is opaque to the assert; we just guarantee it's a non-empty
 *     string so we don't store an empty-keyed row by accident.
 *
 * Anyone authenticated can write. The endpoint that drives the
 * write (`deleteMyAccount`) is the only legitimate path, but if a
 * curious user pokes the datastore directly the worst they can do
 * is bloat the log — there's no PII or principal to leak.
