/**
 * Pre-write guard for `league_members`. The collection holds the
 * `(league, member, role)` triplet that the V1.2 social surface
 * lists, sorts, and counts against.
 *
 *  1. **Key shape.** The doc key must equal
 *     `${leagueId}/${member}`. Drift between key and the embedded
 *     fields is the most common path to a duplicate membership
 *     slipping through; this assertion makes it impossible.
 *
 *  2. **Authorisation model.** A user can write their own
 *     membership row (`member === caller`) — that covers the
 *     join-by-code flow. A league owner can also write rows for
 *     other principals — that covers admin promotion / member
 *     invite. (Demotion / removal under the same gate; a separate
 *     `assertDeleteDoc` will handle leave / kick in a follow-up.)
 *
 *  3. **Identity fields are immutable.** `leagueId`, `member`, and
 *     `joinedAtMs` are write-once. Only `role` can change after the
 *     initial join, and only by the league owner.
 *
 *  4. **Role validation.** Must be one of `owner | admin | member`.
 *     `owner` rows are written at league creation (one per league);
 *     this assert allows that path but rejects subsequent attempts
 *     to mint a second `owner` row for the same league.
 *
 * Follow-up `bouts` collection references both `leagueId` and the
 * member roster — so the integrity guarantees here flow into the
 * bout state machine.
