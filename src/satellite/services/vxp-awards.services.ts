/**
 * Pre-write guard for `vxp_awards`. The collection holds server-fired
 * payouts — streak milestones, comeback grant, referral payouts, Worlds
 * podium — so the rules here protect the economy from forgery and
 * accidental double-credit.
 *
 *  1. **Key shape.** The doc key must equal
 *     `${recipient}/${awardType}/${awardKey}`. Drift between key and
 *     embedded fields is the most common path to a duplicate award
 *     slipping through; this assertion makes it impossible.
 *
 *  2. **Recipient binds caller.** A user can only write awards keyed
 *     to themselves. (The satellite itself signs writes when running
 *     hook code, but those writes still go through this assert with
 *     the recipient as the writing principal.)
 *
 *  3. **Immutable history.** Once a doc reaches `status: 'paid'`, the
 *     `paidAtMs` and `blockIndex` are frozen; any further write that
 *     touches them throws.
 *
 *  4. **Forward-only status.** Status transitions are
 *     `pending → paid | failed` only. `paid → anything` is rejected so a
 *     buggy retry can't quietly demote a successful payout.
 *
 *  5. **Identity fields are immutable.** `awardType`, `awardKey`,
 *     `amountBaseUnits`, `earnedAtMs`, `recipient` are write-once.
 *
 * The follow-up Phase 7 commits will add the streak / comeback / referral
 * hooks that actually create these docs; this assert is the safety net
 * those hooks rely on.
